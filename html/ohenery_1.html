<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Modeling of ordinal outcomes via the softmax function under
the Harville and Henery models.
</p>


<h3>Harville and Henery models</h3>

<p>The Harville and Henery models describe the probability of 
ordered outcomes in terms of some parameters. 
Typically the ordered outcomes are things like place 
in a race, or winner among a large number of contestants.
The Harville model could be described as a softmax probability
for the first place finish, with a recursive model on the
remaining places.
The Henery model generalizes that to adjust the remaining
places with another parameter.
</p>
<p>These are best illustrated with an example.
Suppose you observe a race of 20 contestants.
Contestant number 11 takes first place,
number 6 takes second place, and 17 takes third place,
while the fourth through twentieth places are not
recorded or not of interest.
Under the Harville model, the probability of this outcome
can be expressed as
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\frac{\mu_{11}}{\sum_i \mu_i} \frac{\mu_6}{\sum_{i \ne 11} \mu_i}
\frac{\mu_{17}}{\sum_{i \ne 11, i \ne 6} \mu_i},</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">\mu_i = \exp{\eta_i}</code>.
In a softmax regression under the Harville model, 
one expresses the odds as <code class="reqn">\eta_i = x_i^{\top}\beta</code>, where
<code class="reqn">x_i</code> are independent variables, for some
<code class="reqn">\beta</code> to be fit by the regression.
</p>
<p>Under the Henery model, one adds gammas, <code class="reqn">\gamma_2, \gamma_3, ...</code> such
that the probability of the outcome above is
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\frac{\mu_{11}}{\sum_i \mu_i} \frac{\mu_6^{\gamma_2}}{\sum_{i \ne 11} \mu_i^{\gamma_2}}
\frac{\mu_{17}^{\gamma_3}}{\sum_{i \ne 11, i \ne 6} \mu_i^{\gamma_3}}.</code>
</p>

<p>There is no reason to model a <code class="reqn">\gamma_1</code> as anything but one,
since it would be redundant. 
The Henery softmax regression estimates the <code class="reqn">\beta</code> as well as 
the <code class="reqn">\gamma_j</code>. 
To simplify the regression, the higher order gammas are assumed to equal
the last fit value. That is, we usually model
<code class="reqn">\gamma_5=\gamma_4=\gamma_3</code>.
</p>
<p>The regression supports weighted estimation as well. The weights are
applied to the <em>places</em>, not to the participants. The
weighted likelihood under the example above, for the Harville model
is
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\left(\frac{\mu_{11}}{\sum_i \mu_i}\right)^{w_1} \left(\frac{\mu_6}{\sum_{i \ne 11} \mu_i}\right)^{w_2}
\left(\frac{\mu_{17}}{\sum_{i \ne 11, i \ne 6} \mu_i}\right)^{w_3}.</code>
</p>

<p>The weighting mechanism is how this package deals with unobserved
places.
Rather than marking all runners-up as tied for fourth place, in this
case one sets the <code class="reqn">w_i=0</code> for <code class="reqn">i &gt; 3</code>.
The regression is then not asked to make distinctions between the
tied runners-up.
