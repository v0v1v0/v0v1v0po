<h2>Optmatch Class</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>optmatch</code> class describes the results of an optimal full matching
(using either <code>fullmatch</code> or <code>pairmatch</code>). For the
most part, these objects can be treated as <code>factors</code>.
</p>
<p>The summary function quantifies <code>optmatch</code> objects on the effective sample
size, the distribution of distances between matched units, and how well the
match reduces average differences.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'optmatch'
summary(
  object,
  propensity.model = NULL,
  ...,
  min.controls = 0.2,
  max.controls = 5,
  quantiles = c(0, 0.5, 0.95, 1)
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>The <code>optmatch</code> object to summarize.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>propensity.model</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional propensity model (the result of
a call to <code>glm</code>) to use when summarizing the match. If the
<span class="pkg">RItools</span> package is installed, an additional chi-squared test will
be performed on the average differences between treated and
control units on each variable used in the model. See the
<code>xBalance</code> function in the <span class="pkg">RItools</span> package for more
details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Additional arguments to pass to <code>xBalance</code> when
also passing a propensity model.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>min.controls</code></td>
<td>
<p>To minimize the the display of a groups with
many treated and few controls, all groups with more than 5
treated units will be summarized as “5+”. This is the
reciprocal of the default value (1/5 = 0.2). Lower this value to
see more groups.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max.controls</code></td>
<td>
<p>Like <code>min.controls</code> sets maximum group
sized displayed with respect to the number of controls. Raise
this value to see more groups.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>quantiles</code></td>
<td>
<p>A points in the ECDF at which the distances
between units will be displayed.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>optmatch</code> objects descend from <code>factor</code>.
Elements of this vector correspond to members of the treatment and control
groups in reference to which the matching problem was posed, and are named
accordingly; the names are taken from the row and column names of
<code>distance</code>.  Each element of the vector is either <code>NA</code>, indicating
unavailability of any suitable matches for that element, or the
concatenation of: (i) a character abbreviation of the name of the subclass
(as encoded using <code>exactMatch</code>) (ii) the string <code>.</code>; and
(iii) a non-negative integer.  In this last place, positive whole numbers
indicate placement of the unit into a matched set and <code>NA</code> indicates
that all or part of the matching problem given to <code>fullmatch</code> was found
to be infeasible.  The functions <code>matched</code>,
<code>unmatched</code>, and <code>matchfailed</code> distinguish these
scenarios.
</p>
<p>Secondarily, <code>fullmatch</code> returns various data about the matching
process and its result, stored as attributes of the named vector which is
its primary output.  In particular, the <code>exceedances</code> attribute gives
upper bounds, not necessarily sharp, for the amount by which the sum of
distances between matched units in the result of <code>fullmatch</code> exceeds
the least possible sum of distances between matched units in a feasible
solution to the matching problem given to <code>fullmatch</code>.  (Such a bound
is also printed by <code>print.optmatch</code> and <code>summary.optmatch</code>.)
