<h2>Performs pathway enrichment using over-representation analysis (ORA) or gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function performs enrichment analysis based on statistical test results and full data using clusterProfiler's gsea and enrich functions for MSigDB.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>MSigDB is subset if the  ontology argument is KEGG, GO, or Reactome. test_results must contain estimates for all assays.
Posthoc results can be used but should be filtered for one contrast to improve interpretability.
Alternative statistical results can be used as input as long as they include the columns
"OlinkID", "Assay", and "estimate". A column named "Adjusted_pal" is also needed for ORA. Any statistical results that contains one estimate per protein will work as long as the estimates are comparable to each other.

<p><strong>A few notes on Pathway Enrichment with Olink Data</strong>
</p>
<p>It is important to note that sometimes the proteins that are assayed in Olink Panels
are related to specific biological areas and therefore do not represent an unbiased overview of the proteome as a whole.
Pathways can only interpreted based on the background/context they came from. For this reason, an estimate for all assays measured must
be provided. Furthermore, certain pathways cannot come up based on Olink's  coverage in this area.  Additionally,
if only the Inflammation panel was run, then the available pathways would be given based on a background
of proteins related to inflammation. Both ORA and GSEA can provide mechanistic and disease related insight and are best to use when
trying to uncover pathways/annotations of interest. It is recommended to only use pathway enrichment for hypothesis generating data, which
is more well suited for data on the Explore platform or on multiple Target 96 panels. For smaller lists of proteins it may be more informative to use biological annotation in directed research,
to discover which significant assay are related to keywords of interest.
