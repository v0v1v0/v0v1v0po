<h2>Wrap OxCal commands in Boundary commands</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>wrap_in_boundaries takes a set of Phases or R_Dates as vectors, and returns
a bit of oxcal code that can be used to feed it into OxCal.
In this code the Phases and/or R_Dates are interleaved and wrapped in OxCal Boundaries, the number of Boundaries is equal to the number of strings + 1.
The resulting string starts with a boundary, than the OxCal strings from the vector are interleaved with Boundary commands.
For details concerning the Oxcal simulation please consult the help page of Oxcal.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">wrap_in_boundaries(phases_strings, boundary_names = NA)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>phases_strings</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector containing strings of OxCal code, usually consisting of Phase or R_Date commands, but any other code strings might be used that can be interpreted by OxCal inbetween a Boundary</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>boundary_names</code></td>
<td>
<p>a optional vector of names for the resulting Boundaries (length of phases_strings + 1). If not given, the boundaries are named with consecutive numbers.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a string containing the respective Oxcal code
