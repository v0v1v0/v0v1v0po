<h2>Coerce to a Subcascades Object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Converts from a Groupwise object to a Subcascades object.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">as.subcascades(groupwise = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>groupwise</code></td>
<td>
<p>A Groupwise object, which comprises a two-leveled list. The first level collects cascades of the same size.
The second level contains a list of unique class combinations, labelled as a character string with '-' separating the different classes. 
For each unique set of class combinations the corresponding orders and their performance are given as a matrix, 
where each row contains a cascade, given as a character string of type '1&gt;2&gt;3', and the columns the sensitivity for the class at the corresponding position.
Each matrix is sorted row-wise according to the achieved minimal classwise sensitivites of the cascades (decreasing).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Converts a Groupwise object to a Subcascades object.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A Subcascades object comprising the evaluated cascades and their performances. 
The Subcascades object is made up of a list of matrices. 
Each matrix comprises the evaluation results of cascades of a specific length and 
is sorted row-wise according to the achieved minimal classwise sensitivities of the cascades (decreasing).
The rownames show the class order by a character string of type '1&gt;2&gt;3' and the entries the sensitivity for each position of the cascade.
