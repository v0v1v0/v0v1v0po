<h2>Multivariate Normal Integration</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a covariance matrix, a means vector, and vectors of lower and upper bounds, returns the multivariate normal integral across the space between bounds.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">omxMnor(covariance, means, lbound, ubound)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>covariance</code></td>
<td>
<p>the covariance matrix describing the multivariate normal distribution.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>means</code></td>
<td>
<p>a row vector containing means of the variables of the underlying distribution.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lbound</code></td>
<td>
<p>a row vector containing the lower bounds of the integration in each variable.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ubound</code></td>
<td>
<p>a row vector containing the upper bounds of the integration in each variable.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The order of columns in the ‘means’, ‘lbound’, and ‘ubound’ vectors are assumed to be the same as that of the covariance matrix.  That is, means[i] is considered to be the mean of the variable whose variance is in covariance[i,i].  That variable will be integrated from lbound[i] to ubound[i] as part of the integration.
</p>
<p>The value of ubound[i] or lbound[i] may be set to Inf or -Inf if a boundary at positive or negative infinity is desired.
</p>
<p>For all i, ubound[i] must be strictly greater than lbound[i].
</p>
<p>The algorithm for multivariate normal integration we use is Alan Genz's FORTRAN implementation of the SADMVN routine described by Genz (1992).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
data(myFADataRaw)

covariance &lt;- cov(myFADataRaw[,1:3])
means &lt;- colMeans(myFADataRaw[,1:3])
lbound &lt;- c(-Inf, 0,   1)    # Integrate from -Infinity to 0 on first variable 
ubound &lt;- c(0,    Inf, 2.5)  # From 0 to +Infinity on second, and from 1 to 2.5 on third
omxMnor(covariance, means, lbound, ubound)
# 0.0005995

# An alternative specification of the bounds follows
# Integrate from -Infinity to 0 on first variable 
v1bound = c(-Inf, 0)
# From 0 to +Infinity on second
v2bound = c(0, Inf)
# and from 1 to 2.5 on third
v3bound = c(1, 2.5)
bounds &lt;- cbind(v1bound, v2bound, v3bound)
lbound &lt;- bounds[1,]  
ubound &lt;- bounds[2,]  
omxMnor(covariance, means, lbound, ubound)
