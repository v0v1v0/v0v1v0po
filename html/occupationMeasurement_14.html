<h2>Get the final occupation codes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The final occupation code will depend on the <code>suggestion_id</code> and,
possibly, on <code>followup_answers</code>, depending on the <code>suggestion_id</code> provided. See
<code>occupationMeasurement::auxco$followup_questions</code> for a list of suggestion_ids (=auxco_id)
and their respective recommended follow-up questions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_final_codes(
  suggestion_id,
  followup_answers = list(),
  standardized_answer_levels = NULL,
  approximate_standardized_answer_levels = TRUE,
  code_type = c("isco_08", "kldb_10"),
  verbose = TRUE,
  suggestion_type = "auxco-1.2.x",
  suggestion_type_options = list()
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>suggestion_id</code></td>
<td>
<p>Id of the suggestion</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>followup_answers</code></td>
<td>
<p>A named list of the question_ids with their
respective answers to the followup_questions.
Question ids correspond to list names, answers correspond to list values.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>standardized_answer_levels</code></td>
<td>
<p>A named list of standardized isco
answer levels. Names in the list correspond to the type of isco standard,
values correspond to the level itself.
Possible standardized answer types are: "isco_skill_level" and
"isco_supervisor_manager".
These can be used instead of some followup questions if
the information is available already from a different source.
Please note that standardized answer levels are <em>not</em> available for all
question types. For a list of options please take a look at the
followup questions included in the auxco for example via
<code>occupationMeasurement::auxco$followup_questions</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>approximate_standardized_answer_levels</code></td>
<td>
<p>(default TRUE) Follow up
questions were designed to provide answer options that are not in conflict with suggestion_id.
standardized_answer_levels can be in conflict with suggestion_id, and then no exact matches
exist. With approximation, the answer option that is closest to the
standardized_answer_levels provided, will be used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>code_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>Which type of codes should be returned.
Multiple codes can be returned at the same time.
Supported types of codes are "isco_08" and "kldb_10".
Defaults to "isco_08" and "kldb_10".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>(default TRUE) whether to return a <code>message</code> or not, detailing potential issues with the input provided.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>suggestion_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>Which suggestion type is being used.
Only auxco-based suggestion_types are supported.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>suggestion_type_options</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list with options for generating
suggestions. Supported options:
- <code>datasets</code>: Pass specific datasets to be used whenn adding information
to predictions e.g. use a specific version of the kldb or auxco.
Supported datasets are: "auxco-1.2.x", "kldb-2010". By default the datasets
bundled with this package are used.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The interview situation may not allow to ask these follow-up questions. Some default, but
suboptimal occupation code is returned if <code>followup_answers</code> is missing.
</p>
<p>If <code>followup_answers</code> is missing or incomplete, one may wish to insert/infer the missing information
by using <code>standardized_answer_levels</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A named list corresponding to the code_type(s) specified. Includes a <code>message</code> if <code>verbose = TRUE</code>
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">

## Not run: 
get_final_codes(
  # F端hrungsaufgaben mit Personalverantwortung  bei der Lebensmittelherstellung
  "9076",
  followup_answers = list(
    # The first answer option in the first followup question
    "Q9076_1" = 2
  )
)

# The same, but using standardized answer levels
get_final_codes(
  # F端hrungsaufgaben mit Personalverantwortung  bei der Lebensmittelherstellung
  "9076",
  standardized_answer_levels = list(
    # A response corresponding to the standard ISCO Level "supervisor"
    "isco_supervisor_manager" = "isco_supervisor"
  )
)

# Same example with approximate matching, due to conflicting information:
# External data suggest the person is not a supervisor, but the person still
# says she does supervisory tasks (F端hrungsaufgaben, as encoded in "9076").
# If approximate_standardized_answer_levels = TRUE (the default), the
# selected answer "9076" trumps the external data and we will code this
# person as a supervisor.
get_final_codes(
  # F端hrungsaufgaben mit Personalverantwortung  bei der Lebensmittelherstellung
  "9076",
  standardized_answer_levels = list(
    # A response corresponding to the standard ISCO Level "not manager nor supervisor"
    "isco_supervisor_manager" = "isco_not_supervising"
  )
