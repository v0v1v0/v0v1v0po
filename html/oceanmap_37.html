oceanmap - plot tools for 2D oceanographic data  
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>oceanmap</code> is a plotting toolbox for oceanographic data.
Visualizing data is a crucial step in analyzing and exploring data. During the last two decades the statistical programming language R has become a major tool for data analyses and visualization across different fields of science. However, creating figures ready for scientific publication can be a tricky and time consuming task. 
</p>
<p>The <code>oceanmap</code> package provides some helpful functions to facilitate and optimize the visualization of geographic and oceanographic data, such as satellite and bathymetric data sets. Its plotting functions are written in a way that they do not require a large amount of their numerous arguments to be specified but still return nice plots. Its major functions are:
</p>
<p><b>Major functions:</b><br></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>plotmap: plots landmask as basis or overlay
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>v: plots oceanographic data (fronts, SST, chla, bathymetry, etc.) from raster-objects, ncdf4- or gz-files
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>set.colorbar: adds a colorbar to current figure, allowing several placement methods
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>get.bathy: download bahymetric data at user defined resolution from the NOAA ETOPO1 database
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>add.region: generate region definitions to facilitate land mask and colorbar plotting using plotmap and v
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>figure &amp; close_fig: generate and save graphic devices in flexible file formats (jpeg, png, eps, pdf and eps)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
