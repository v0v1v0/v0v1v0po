<h2>Normalize Outcome/Response to \[0,1\] Interval</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function takes a continuous (double) column of data and converts it
to have 0 as the lower bound and 1 as the upper bound.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">normalize(outcome, true_bounds = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>outcome</code></td>
<td>
<p>Any non-character vector. Factors will be converted
to numeric via coercion.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>true_bounds</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specify this parameter with the lower and upper bound
if the observed min/max of the outcome should not be used. Useful when
an upper or lower bound exists but the observed data is less than/more than
that bound. The normalization function will respect these bounds.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Beta regression can only be done with a response that is continuous with a
lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 1. However, it is
straightforward to transform any lower and upper-bounded continuous
variable to the \[0,1\] interval. This function does the transformation
and saves the original bounds as attributes so that the bounds can be
reverse-transformed.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A numeric vector with an upper bound of 1 and a lower bound of
0. The original bounds are saved in the attributes "lower_bound" and
"upper_bound".
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># set up arbitrary upper and lower-bounded vector
outcome &lt;- runif(1000, min=-33, max=445)

# normalize to \[0,1\]

trans_outcome &lt;- normalize(outcome=outcome)
summary(trans_outcome)

# only works with numeric vectors and factors

  try(normalize(outcome=c('a','b')))

</code></pre>
