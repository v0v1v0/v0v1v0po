<h2>Generate P-values using empirical randomization null distribution</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Randomize the treatment assignment within strata to generate the randomization distribution of covariate balance
given the strata and observed covariate values. Compare the observed covariate balance to this null distribution
to calculate P-values.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rand_pvals(
  object = NULL,
  z = NULL,
  X = NULL,
  base_strata = NULL,
  refined_strata = NULL,
  options = list()
)
</code></pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The literature on multivariate matching has recently developed a new way of evaluating covariate imbalances,
comparing the imbalances found in an observational matched sample to
the imbalances that would have been produced in the same data by randomization
(Pimentel et al. 2015, Yu 2021).
We modify that approach for use with strata, randomizing patients within strata.
For a given stratification, we create a large number of stratified randomized experiments,
taking the actual patients in their actual strata, and randomizing them to
treatment or control with fixed within-stratum sample sizes.
</p>
<p>To investigate how the actual observational imbalance in covariates compares to
covariate imbalance in the randomized experiments built from the same strata, patients and covariates,
we look at 4 metricsâ€“ the scaled objective value, which is a weighted combination
of the maximum and the sum of all SMDs, depending on the <code>criterion</code> argument,
the maximum and average SMDs across covariates and strata,
and the average SMD across strata for each covariate individually.
For each of these metrics, we record the observational value,
the median and minimum of the randomized values,
and the proportion of randomized values more imbalanced than the observational value (the P-value).
</p>
<p>The <code>options</code> list argument can contain any of the following elements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>nrand: how many times to randomize the treatment assignment when forming the null distribution.
Default is 10000
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>criterion: which optimization criterion to use when calculating the objective value.
Options are "max", "sum", or "combo", referring to whether to include the
maximum standardized mean difference (SMD), the sum of all SMDs,
or a combination of the maximum and the sum. The default is "combo"
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wMax: how much to weight the maximum standardized mean difference compared to the sum.
Only used if criterion is set to "combo". Default is 5
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>incl_base: whether to include columns for the initial stratification in the table.
Default is <code>TRUE</code> if a base stratification is provided
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>List with three components:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>pvals: list containing <code>base</code> and <code>refined</code> elements, each of which is a list with randomization P-values
for the objective value (<code>NULL</code> for the base stratification),
the maximum standardized mean difference (SMD),
the average SMD across covariates and strata,
and for the average SMD across strata for each covariate (this element is a vector)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>obs_details: list containing <code>base</code> and <code>refined</code> elements, each of which is a list with
the observed values for
the objective value (<code>NULL</code> for the base stratification),
the maximum standardized mean difference (SMD),
and for the average SMD across strata for each covariate (this element is a vector)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rand_details: list containing <code>base</code> and <code>refined</code> elements, each of which is a list with
a vector of <code>nrand</code> randomized values for
the objective value (<code>NULL</code> for the base stratification),
the maximum standardized mean difference (SMD),
and for the average SMD across strata for each covariate
(this element is a matrix with <code>nrand</code> rows and a column for each covariate)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Choose 500 patients and 5 covariates to work with for the example
set.seed(15)
samp &lt;- sample(1:nrow(rhc_X), 500)
cov_samp &lt;- sample(1:26, 5)

# Let it create propensity score strata for you and then refine them
ref &lt;- refine(X = rhc_X[samp, cov_samp], z = rhc_X[samp, "z"])

# Calculate info for covariate balance randomization distribution
rpvals &lt;- rand_pvals(object = ref, options = list(nrand = 100))

# Look at pvals before and after
rpvals$pvals
