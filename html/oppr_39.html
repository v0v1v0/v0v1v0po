<h2>Add a random solver</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Specify that solutions should be generated using random processes. Although
prioritizations should be developed using optimization routines,
a portfolio of randomly generated solutions can be useful for evaluating
the effectiveness of solutions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_random_solver(x, number_solutions = 1, verbose = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>ProjectProblem object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>number_solutions</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>integer</code> number of solutions desired.
Defaults to 1. Note that the number of returned solutions can sometimes
be less than the argument to <code>number_solutions</code> depending on the
argument to <code>solution_pool_method</code>, for example if 100
solutions are requested but only 10 unique solutions exist, then only 10
solutions will be returned.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The algorithm used to randomly generate solutions depends on the
the objective specified for the project prioritization
<code>problem()</code>.
</p>
<p>For objectives which maximize benefit subject to budgetary constraints
(e.g. <code>add_max_richness_objective()</code>):
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> All locked in and zero-cost actions are initially
selected for funding (excepting actions which are locked out).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A project—and all of its associated actions—is randomly selected
for funding (excepting projects associated with locked out actions,
and projects which would cause the budget to be exceeded when added
to the existing set of selected actions).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The previous step is repeated until no more projects can be
selected for funding without the total cost of the prioritized actions
exceeding the budget.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For objectives which minimize cost subject to biodiversity constraints
(i.e. <code>add_min_set_objective()</code>:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> All locked in and zero-cost actions are initially
selected for funding (excepting actions which are locked out).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A project—and all of its associated actions—is randomly selected
for funding (excepting projects associated with locked out actions,
and projects which would cause the budget to be exceeded when added
to the existing set of selected actions).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The previous step is repeated until all of the persistence targets
are met.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># load data
data(sim_projects, sim_features, sim_actions)

# build problem with random solver, and generate 100 random solutions
p1 &lt;- problem(sim_projects, sim_actions, sim_features,

     add_random_solver(number_solutions = 100)

# print problem

# solve problem

# since the objective values don't tell us much about the quality of the

# plot histogram showing the quality of the random solutions
# higher numbers indicate worse solutions
