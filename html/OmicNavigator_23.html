<h2>Combine two or more studies</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create a new OmicNavigator study by combining two or more existing study
objects.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">combineStudies(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Two or more objects of class <code>onStudy</code></p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is a convenience function to quickly and conveniently combine studies.
However, it is naive, and you will likely need to edit the new study after
combining. When there are conflicting elements (e.g. different study names or
different maintainers), then the value for the latter study is kept. As a
concrete example, if you combined 5 studies, the name of the combined study
would be the name of the 5th study.
</p>
<p>The behavior is more complex for study elements that are nested lists of data
frames (e.g. results). If the 5 studies included a results table for the same
modelID/testID combination, then only the results from the 5th study would be
retained. However, if they each defined a different modelID, then the results
for all 5 modelIDs would be included in the combined study. Please note that
you should be extra cautious in the situation where the studies have the same
modelID/testID combination. Ideally they should all have the same column
names. Since a data frame is technically a list, the workhorse function
<code>modifyList</code> will retain any uniquely named
columns from earlier studies along with the columns from the final study.
</p>
<p>Note that as a shortcut you can also combine studies using the S3 method
<code>c</code>.
</p>
<p>If a study you would like to combine is already installed, you can convert it
to a study object by importing it with <code>importStudy</code>.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a new combined OmicNavigator study object, which is a named
nested list with class <code>onStudy</code>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# Define threee study objects
studyOne &lt;- createStudy(name = "One",
                        description = "First study",
                        studyMeta = list(metafield1 = "metavalue1"))

studyTwo &lt;- createStudy(name = "Two",
                        description = "Second study",
                        maintainer = "The Maintainer",
                        studyMeta = list(metafield2 = "metavalue2"))

studyThree &lt;- createStudy(name = "Three",
                          description = "Third study",
                          studyMeta = list(metafield3 = "metavalue3"))

# Combine the three studies
combineStudies(studyOne, studyTwo, studyThree)

# Equivalently, can use c()
c(studyOne, studyTwo, studyThree)
