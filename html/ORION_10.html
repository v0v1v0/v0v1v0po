<h2>Coerce to a Groupwise object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Converts from a Subcascades object to a Groupwise object.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">groupwise(subcascades = NULL, maxCl = 50)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>subcascades</code></td>
<td>
<p>A Subcascades object as it is returned by <code>subcascades</code>-function.
The Subcascades object is made up of a list of matrices. 
Each matrix comprises the evaluation results of cascades of a specific length and 
is sorted row-wise according to the achieved minimal classwise sensitivities of the cascades (decreasing).
The rownames show the class order by a character string of type '1&gt;2&gt;3' and the entries the sensitivity for each position of the cascade.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maxCl</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer defining the lower bound for the maximal number of classes. Has only to be set if the analyzed dataset has more than 50 classes.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function re-sorts the Subcascades object in a way that the cascades made up of the same classes are grouped.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A Groupwise object, which comprises a two-leveled list. The first level collects cascades of the same size.
The second level contains a list of unique class combinations, labelled as a character string with '-' separating the different classes. 
For each unique set of class combinations the corresponding orders and their performance are given as a matrix, 
where each row contains a cascade, given as a character string of type '1&gt;2&gt;3', and the columns the sensitivity for the class at the corresponding position.
Each matrix is sorted row-wise according to the achieved minimal classwise sensitivites of the cascades (decreasing).
