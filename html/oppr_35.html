<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A problem objective is used to specify the overall goal of the
project prioritization problem.
Here, the maximum phylogenetic diversity objective seeks to find the set
of actions that maximizes the expected amount of evolutionary history
that is expected to persist into the future given the evolutionary
relationships between the features (e.g. populations, species).
Let <code class="reqn">I</code> represent the set of conservation actions (indexed by
<code class="reqn">i</code>). Let <code class="reqn">C_i</code> denote the cost for funding action <code class="reqn">i</code>, and
let <code class="reqn">m</code> denote the maximum expenditure (i.e. the budget). Also,
let <code class="reqn">F</code> represent each feature (indexed by <code class="reqn">f</code>), <code class="reqn">W_f</code>
represent the weight for each feature <code class="reqn">f</code> (defaults to zero for
each feature unless specified otherwise), and <code class="reqn">E_f</code>
denote the probability that each feature will go extinct given the funded
conservation projects.
</p>
<p>To describe the
evolutionary relationships between the features <code class="reqn">f \in F</code>,
consider a phylogenetic tree that contains features <code class="reqn">f \in F</code>
with branches of known lengths. This tree can be described using
mathematical notation by letting <code class="reqn">B</code> represent the branches (indexed by
<code class="reqn">b</code>) with lengths <code class="reqn">L_b</code> and letting <code class="reqn">T_{bf}</code> indicate which
features <code class="reqn">f \in F</code> are associated with which phylogenetic
branches <code class="reqn">b \in B</code> using zeros and ones. Ideally, the set of
features <code class="reqn">F</code> would contain all of the species in the study
area—including non-threatened species—to fully account for the benefits
for funding different actions.
</p>
<p>To guide the prioritization, the conservation actions are organized into
conservation projects. Let <code class="reqn">J</code> denote the set of conservation projects
(indexed by <code class="reqn">j</code>), and let <code class="reqn">A_{ij}</code> denote which actions
<code class="reqn">i \in I</code> comprise each conservation project
<code class="reqn">j \in J</code> using zeros and ones. Next, let <code class="reqn">P_j</code> represent
the probability of project <code class="reqn">j</code> being successful if it is funded. Also,
let <code class="reqn">B_{fj}</code> denote the enhanced probability that each feature
<code class="reqn">f \in F</code> associated with the project <code class="reqn">j \in J</code>
will persist if all of the actions that comprise project <code class="reqn">j</code> are funded
and that project is allocated to feature <code class="reqn">f</code>.
For convenience,
let <code class="reqn">Q_{fj}</code> denote the actual probability that each
<code class="reqn">f \in F</code> associated with the project <code class="reqn">j \in J</code>
is expected to persist if the project is funded. If the argument
to <code>adjust_for_baseline</code> in the <code>problem</code> function was set to
<code>TRUE</code>, and this is the default behavior, then
<code class="reqn">Q_{fj} = (P_{j} \times B_{fj}) + \bigg(\big(1 - (P_{j} B_{fj})\big)
  \times (P_{n} \times B_{fn})\bigg)</code>, where <code>n</code> corresponds to the
baseline "do nothing" project. This means that the probability
of a feature persisting if a project is allocated to a feature
depends on (i) the probability of the project succeeding, (ii) the
probability of the feature persisting if the project does not fail,
and (iii) the probability of the feature persisting even if the project
fails. Otherwise, if the argument is set to <code>FALSE</code>, then
<code class="reqn">Q_{fj} = P_{j} \times B_{fj}</code>.
</p>
<p>The binary control variables <code class="reqn">X_i</code> in this problem indicate whether
each project <code class="reqn">i \in I</code> is funded or not. The decision
variables in this problem are the <code class="reqn">Y_{j}</code>, <code class="reqn">Z_{fj}</code>, <code class="reqn">E_f</code>,
and <code class="reqn">R_b</code> variables.
Specifically, the binary <code class="reqn">Y_{j}</code> variables indicate if project <code class="reqn">j</code>
is funded or not based on which actions are funded; the binary
<code class="reqn">Z_{fj}</code> variables indicate if project <code class="reqn">j</code> is used to manage
feature <code class="reqn">f</code> or not; the semi-continuous <code class="reqn">E_f</code> variables
denote the probability that feature <code class="reqn">f</code> will go extinct; and
the semi-continuous <code class="reqn">R_b</code> variables denote the probability that
phylogenetic branch <code class="reqn">b</code> will remain in the future.
</p>
<p>Now that we have defined all the data and variables, we can formulate
the problem. For convenience, let the symbol used to denote each set also
represent its cardinality (e.g. if there are ten features, let <code class="reqn">F</code>
represent the set of ten features and also the number ten).

<p>The objective (eqn 1a) is to maximize the expected phylogenetic diversity
(Faith 2008) plus the probability each feature will remain multiplied
by their weights (noting that the feature weights default to zero).
Constraint (eqn 1b) limits the maximum expenditure (i.e.
ensures that the cost of the funded actions do not exceed the budget).
Constraints (eqn 1c) calculate the probability that each branch
(including tips that correspond to a single feature) will go extinct
according to the probability that the features which share a given
branch will go extinct.
Constraints (eqn 1d) calculate the probability that each feature
will go extinct according to their allocated project.
Constraints (eqn 1e) ensure that feature can only be allocated to projects
that have all of their actions funded. Constraints (eqn 1f) state that each
feature can only be allocated to a single project. Constraints (eqn 1g)
ensure that a project cannot be funded unless all of its actions are funded.
Constraints (eqns 1h) ensure that the probability variables
(<code class="reqn">E_f</code>) are bounded between zero and one. Constraints (eqns 1i) ensure
that the action funding (<code class="reqn">X_i</code>), project funding (<code class="reqn">Y_j</code>), and
project allocation (<code class="reqn">Z_{fj}</code>) variables are binary.
</p>
<p>Although this formulation is a mixed integer quadratically constrained
programming problem (due to eqn 1c), it can be approximated using
linear terms and then solved using commercial mixed integer programming
solvers. This can be achieved by substituting the product of the feature
extinction probabilities (eqn 1c) with the sum of the log feature extinction
probabilities and using piecewise linear approximations (described in
Hillier &amp; Price 2005 pp. 390–392) to approximate the exponent of this term.
