<h3>Description</h3>

<p>OptimStrat is a package intended to assist in the choice of the sample strategy to implement in a survey. It allows for calculating the variance and the expected variance of several sampling strategies.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package includes a function to calculate the design variance of several sampling strategies. It also includes a function to calculate the expected variance under a superpopuation model and a web-based application where the user can compare five sampling strategies in order to determine which one to implement in a survey.
