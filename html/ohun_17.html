peak.amplitude = 0, hop.size = 11.6, wl = NULL, smooth = 5, hold.time = 0,
min.duration = NULL, max.duration = NULL, thinning = 1, cores = 1, pb = TRUE,

</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reference</code></td>
<td>
<p>Selection table (using the warbleR package's format, see <code>selection_table</code>) or data frame with columns
for sound file name (sound.files), selection number (selec), and start and end time of sound event
(start and end). <strong>It must contain the reference selections that will be used for detection optimization</strong>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>files</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character vector indicating the sound files that will be analyzed. Optional. If  not supplied the function will work on the sound files in 'reference'. It can be used to include sound files with no target sound events. Supported file formats:'.wav', '.mp3', '.flac' and '.wac'. If not supplied the function will work on all sound files (in the supported format) in 'path'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>threshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector specifying the amplitude threshold for detecting
sound events (in %). Default is 5. <strong>Several values can be supplied for optimization</strong>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>peak.amplitude</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector of length 1 with the minimum peak amplitude value. A detection below that value would be excluded. Peak amplitude is the maximum sound pressure level (in decibels) across the sound event (see <code>sound_pressure_level</code>). This can be useful when expecting higher peak amplitude in the target sound events compared to non-target sound events or when keeping only the best examples of the target sound events (i.e. high precision and low recall). Default is 0. <strong>Several values can be supplied for optimization</strong>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>hop.size</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector of length 1 specifying the time window duration (in ms). Default is 11.6 ms, which is equivalent to 512 wl for a 44.1 kHz sampling rate. Ignored if 'wl' is supplied.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>wl</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector of length 1 specifying the window length of the spectrogram. Default is <code>NULL</code>. If supplied, 'hop.size' is ignored. Used internally for bandpass filtering (so only applied when 'bp' is supplied).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>smooth</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector of length 1 to smooth the amplitude envelope
with a sum smooth function. It controls the time 'neighborhood' (in ms) in which amplitude samples are smoothed (i.e. averaged with neighboring samples). Default is 5. 0 means no smoothing is applied. Note that smoothing is applied before thinning (see 'thinning' argument). The function  <code>envelope</code> is used internally which is analogous to sum smoothing in <code>env</code>. This argument is used internally by <code>get_envelopes</code>. <strong>Several values can be supplied for optimization</strong>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>hold.time</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector of length 1. Specifies the time range (in ms) at which selections will be merged (i.e. if 2 selections are separated by less than the specified 'hold.time' they will be merged in to a single selection). Default is <code>0</code> (no hold time applied). <strong>Several values can be supplied for optimization</strong>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>min.duration</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector giving the shortest duration (in
ms) of the sound events to be detected. It removes sound events below that
threshold. <strong>Several values can be supplied for optimization</strong>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max.duration</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector giving the longest duration (in
ms) of the sound events to be detected. It removes sound events above that
threshold. <strong>Several values can be supplied for optimization</strong>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>thinning</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector in the range 0~1 indicating the proportional reduction of the number of
samples used to represent amplitude envelopes (i.e. the thinning of the envelopes). Usually amplitude envelopes have many more samples
than those needed to accurately represent amplitude variation in time, which affects the size of the
output (usually very large R objects / files). Default is  <code>1</code> (no thinning). Higher sampling rates may afford higher size reduction (e.g. lower thinning values). Reduction is conducted by interpolation using <code>approx</code>. Note that thinning may decrease time precision, and the higher the thinning the less precise the time detection. <strong>Several values can be supplied for optimization</strong>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cores</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric. Controls whether parallel computing is applied.
It specifies the number of cores to be used. Default is 1 (i.e. no parallel computing).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pb</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical argument to control progress bar and messages. Default is <code>TRUE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>by.sound.file</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical argument to control whether performance diagnostics are summarized across sound files (when <code>by.sound.file = FALSE</code> and more than 1 sound file is included in 'reference') or shown separated by sound file. Default is <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bp</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector of length 2 giving the lower and upper limits of a
frequency bandpass filter (in kHz). Default is <code>NULL</code>.  This argument is used internally by <code>get_envelopes</code>. Not used if 'envelopes' are supplied. Bandpass is done using the function <code>ffilter</code>, which applies a short-term Fourier transformation to first create a spectrogram in which the target frequencies are filtered and then is back transformed into a wave object using a reverse Fourier transformation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>path</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character string containing the directory path where the sound files are located.
The current working directory is used as default.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>previous.output</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data frame with the output of a previous run of this function. This will be used to include previous results in the new output and avoid recalculating detection performance for parameter combinations previously evaluated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>envelopes</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class 'envelopes' (generated by <code>get_envelopes</code>) containing the amplitude envelopes of the sound files to be analyzed. If 'files' and 'envelopes' are not supplied then the function will work on all supported format sound files in the working directory.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>macro.average</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical argument to control if diagnostics are first calculated for each sound file and then averaged across sound files, which can minimize the effect of unbalanced sample sizes between sound files. If <code>FALSE</code> (default) diagnostics are based on aggregated statistics irrespective of sound files. The following indices can be estimated by macro-averaging: overlap, mean.duration.true.positives, mean.duration.false.positives, mean.duration.false.positives, mean.duration.false.negatives, proportional.duration.true.positives, recall and precision (f.score is always derived from recall and precision). Note that when applying macro-averaging, recall and precision are not derived from the true positive, false positive and false negative values returned by the function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>min.overlap</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric. Controls the minimum amount of overlap required for a detection and a reference sound for it to be counted as true positive. Default is 0.5. Overlap is measured as intersection over union.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function takes a selections data frame or 'selection_table' ('reference') estimates the detection performance of a energy detector under different detection parameter combinations. This is done by comparing the position in time of the detection to those of the reference selections in 'reference'. The function returns several diagnostic metrics to allow user to determine which parameter values provide a detection that more closely matches the selections in 'reference'. Those parameters can be later used for performing a more efficient detection using <code>energy_detector</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A data frame in which each row shows the result of a detection job with a particular combination of tuning parameters (including in the data frame). It also includes the following diagnostic metrics:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>true.positives</code>: number of sound events in 'reference' that correspond to any detection. Matching is defined as some degree of overlap in time. In a perfect detection routine it should be equal to the number of rows in 'reference'.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>false.positives</code>: number of detections that don't match any of the sound events in 'reference'. In a perfect detection routine it should be 0.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>false.negatives</code>: number of sound events in 'reference' that were not detected (not found in 'detection'. In a perfect detection routine it should be 0.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>splits</code>: number of detections overlapping reference sounds that also overlap with other detections. In a perfect detection routine it should be 0.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>merges</code>: number of detections that overlap with two or more reference sounds. In a perfect detection routine it should be 0.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>mean.duration.true.positives</code>: mean duration of true positives (in ms). Only included when <code>time.diagnostics = TRUE</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>mean.duration.false.positives</code>: mean duration of false positives (in ms). Only included when <code>time.diagnostics = TRUE</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>mean.duration.false.negatives</code>: mean duration of false negatives (in ms). Only included when <code>time.diagnostics = TRUE</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>overlap</code>: mean intersection over union overlap of true positives.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>proportional.duration.true.positives</code>: ratio of duration of true positives to th duration of sound events in 'reference'. In a perfect detection routine it should be 1. Based only on true positives that were not split or merged. Only included when <code>time.diagnostics = TRUE</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>duty.cycle</code>: proportion of a sound file in which sounds were detected. Only included when <code>time.diagnostics = TRUE</code> and <code>path</code> is supplied.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>recall</code>: Proportion of sound events in 'reference' that were detected. In a perfect detection routine it should be 1.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>precision</code>: Proportion of detections that correspond to sound events in 'reference'. In a perfect detection routine it should be 1.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
