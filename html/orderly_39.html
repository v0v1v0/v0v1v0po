<h2>Orderly remote at a different path</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create a "handle" for interacting with orderly repositories that
are hosted at a different path.  This might be useful in cases
where you have access to an orderly repository via a network mount
or a synchronised folder (e.g., Dropbox, Box, etc).  More
generally, <code>orderly_remote_path</code> implements an interface
used by orderly to abstract over different ways that orderly
repositories might be hosted remotely, including over HTTP APIs.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">orderly_remote_path(path, name = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>path</code></td>
<td>
<p>Path to the orderly store</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>name</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of the remote</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An <code>orderly_remote_path</code> object, with methods that
orderly will use in order to control this remote
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><code>orderly_pull_dependencies()</code> and
<code>orderly_pull_archive()</code>, which are the primary ways
these remote objects are used.  See also
<a href="https://github.com/vimc/orderly-web">OrderlyWeb</a> for a
system for hosting orderly repositories over an HTTP API.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Suppose we have a "remote" orderly repository at some path.
# This might be read-only for you in practice and available via a
# network filesystem or a dropbox folder synced to your computer.
# We'll populate this with a pair of reports:
path_remote &lt;- orderly::orderly_example("demo")
id &lt;- orderly::orderly_run("other", list(nmin = 0),
                           root = path_remote, echo = FALSE)
orderly::orderly_commit(id, root = path_remote)
id &lt;- orderly::orderly_run("use_dependency",
                           root = path_remote, echo = FALSE)
orderly::orderly_commit(id, root = path_remote)

# We'll create a an object to interact with this remote using
# orderly_remote_path.
remote &lt;- orderly::orderly_remote_path(path_remote)

# We can use this object directly
remote$list_reports()
remote$list_versions("other")

# More typically one will interact with the functions
# orderly_pull_archive and orderly_pull_dependencies.

# Now, suppose that you have your "local" copy of this; it shares
# the same source (ordinarily these would both be under version
# control with git):
path_local &lt;- orderly::orderly_example("demo")

# If we wanted to run the report "use_dependency" we need to have
# a copy of the report "other", on which it depends:
try(orderly::orderly_run("use_dependency", root = path_local))

# We can "pull" dependencies of a report before running
orderly::orderly_pull_dependencies("use_dependency", remote = remote,
                                   root = path_local)

# Now we can run the report because we have a local copy of the
# dependency:
orderly::orderly_run("use_dependency", root = path_local)

# We can also directly pull previously run reports:
orderly::orderly_pull_archive("use_dependency", id, remote = remote,
                              root = path_local)
orderly::orderly_list_archive(root = path_local)
