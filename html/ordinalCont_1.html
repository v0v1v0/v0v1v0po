<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Regression analysis of continous ordinal data via cumulative link models and cumulative link mixed models. The package can be used to fit a variety of transformation models.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Ordinal regression analysis is a convenient tool for analyzing ordinal response variables 
in the presence of covariates. We extend this methodology to the case of continuous self-rating 
scales such as the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) used in pain assessment, or the Linear Analog 
Self-Assessment (LASA) scales in quality of life studies. Subjects are
typically given a linear scale of 100 mm and asked to put a mark where they perceive
themselves. These scales  measure subjects' 
perception of an intangible quantity, and cannot be handled as ratio variables because of their 
inherent nonlinearity.  Instead we treat them as ordinal variables, measured on a continuous scale. We 
express  the likelihood in terms of a function (the “g function”) connecting the  
scale with an underlying continuous latent  variable. In the current version the g function 
is expressed with monotone increasing I-splines (Ramsey 1988).
The link function is the inverse of the CDF of the assumed underlying distribution of the 
latent variable. Currently 
the logit link, which corresponds to a standard logistic distribution, is implemented. 
(This implies a proportional odds model.)  The likelihood is 
maximized using the <code>MI</code> algorithm (Ma, 2010). Fixed- and mixed-effects models are implemented 
in the function <code>ocm</code>.
