Constructing and evaluating oncogenetic trees
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Oncogenetic trees are directed tree structures that  model the process of
occurrence of genetic alterations during carcinogenesis.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A <b>pure oncogenetic tree</b> is a directed rooted tree <em>T</em> with a
probability <code class="reqn">\pi (e)</code> attached to each edge <em>e</em> such that
for every vertex there is a unique directed path from the root to
it along the edges of the tree. This tree
generates observations on the presence/absence of genetic events the following
way: each edge <em>e</em> is independently retained with probability <code class="reqn">\pi
(e)</code>; the set of vertices that are still reachable from the root 
gives the set of the observed genetic events.
</p>
<p>To describe random deviations from the pure tree model an error model
is added. 
</p>

</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> The tumor develops according to the pure oncogenetic tree
model
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The presence/absence of each alteration is independently
measured
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If the alteration is present it is not observed with
probability <code class="reqn">\epsilon_-</code>.
</p>
<p>If the alteration is absent it is observed with
probability <code class="reqn">\epsilon_+</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
