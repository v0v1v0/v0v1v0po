<h2>Exclude Cascades Based on Threshold</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Filters out all cascades that match the comparison with a minimal classwise sensitivity threshold.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dropThreshold(subcascades = NULL, comparison = "&gt;=", thresh = 0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>subcascades</code></td>
<td>
<p>A Subcascades object as it is returned by <code>subcascades</code>-function.
The Subcascades object is made up of a list of matrices. 
Each matrix comprises the evaluation results of cascades of a specific length and 
is sorted row-wise according to the achieved minimal classwise sensitivities of the cascades (decreasing).
The rownames show the class order by a character string of type '1&gt;2&gt;3' and the entries the sensitivity for each position of the cascade.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>comparison</code></td>
<td>
<p>Defines the comparison type (&lt;,&gt;,&lt;=,&gt;=) for the threshold.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>thresh</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric value between 0 and 1.
The minimal sensitivity threshold used to filter the returned cascades. 
Only cascades that pass this threshold are returned. 
If 0 is used the returned cascades are filtered for &gt;0 and otherwise &gt;= thresh.
For low thresholds the calculation lasts longer.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A Subcascades object comprising the evaluated cascades and their performances. 
The Subcascades object is made up of a list of matrices. 
Each matrix comprises the evaluation results of cascades of a specific length and 
is sorted row-wise according to the achieved minimal classwise sensitivities of the cascades (decreasing).
The rownames show the class order by a character string of type '1&gt;2&gt;3' and the entries the sensitivity for each position of the cascade.
