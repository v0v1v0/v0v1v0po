<h2>Function for plotting bivariate polar plots with smoothing.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function for plotting pollutant concentration in polar coordinates showing
concentration by wind speed (or another numeric variable) and direction. Mean
concentrations are calculated for wind speed-direction ‘bins’ (e.g.
0-1, 1-2 m/s,...  and 0-10, 10-20 degrees etc.).  To aid interpretation,
<code>gam</code> smoothing is carried out using <code>mgcv</code>.

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mydata</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame minimally containing <code>wd</code>, another variable
to plot in polar coordinates (the default is a column “ws” — wind
speed) and a pollutant. Should also contain <code>date</code> if plots by time
period are required.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pollutant</code></td>
<td>
<p>Mandatory. A pollutant name corresponding to a variable in a
data frame should be supplied e.g. <code>pollutant = "nox"</code>. There can also
be more than one pollutant specified e.g. <code>pollutant = c("nox",
  "no2")</code>. The main use of using two or more pollutants is for model
evaluation where two species would be expected to have similar
concentrations. This saves the user stacking the data and it is possible to
work with columns of data directly. A typical use would be <code>pollutant
  = c("obs", "mod")</code> to compare two columns “obs” (the observations)
and “mod” (modelled values). When pair-wise statistics such as
Pearson correlation and regression techniques are to be plotted,
<code>pollutant</code> takes two elements too. For example, <code>pollutant =
  c("bc", "pm25")</code> where <code>"bc"</code> is a function of <code>"pm25"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of variable to plot against wind direction in polar
coordinates, the default is wind speed, “ws”.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>wd</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of wind direction field.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>type</code> determines how the data are split i.e. conditioned,
and then plotted. The default is will produce a single plot using the
entire data. Type can be one of the built-in types as detailed in
<code>cutData</code> e.g. “season”, “year”, “weekday” and so
on. For example, <code>type = "season"</code> will produce four plots — one for
each season.
</p>
<p>It is also possible to choose <code>type</code> as another variable in the data
frame. If that variable is numeric, then the data will be split into four
quantiles (if possible) and labelled accordingly. If type is an existing
character or factor variable, then those categories/levels will be used
directly. This offers great flexibility for understanding the variation of
different variables and how they depend on one another.
</p>
<p>Type can be up length two e.g. <code>type = c("season", "weekday")</code> will
produce a 2x2 plot split by season and day of the week. Note, when two
types are provided the first forms the columns and the second the rows.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>statistic</code></td>
<td>
<p>The statistic that should be applied to each wind
speed/direction bin. Because of the smoothing involved, the colour scale
for some of these statistics is only to provide an indication of overall
pattern and should not be interpreted in concentration units e.g. for
<code>statistic = "weighted.mean"</code> where the bin mean is multiplied by the
bin frequency and divided by the total frequency. In many cases using
<code>polarFreq</code> will be better. Setting <code>statistic = "weighted.mean"</code>
can be useful because it provides an indication of the concentration *
frequency of occurrence and will highlight the wind speed/direction
conditions that dominate the overall mean.Can be:
</p>
 <ul>
<li>  <p>“mean” (default), “median”, “max”
(maximum), “frequency”. “stdev” (standard deviation),
“weighted.mean”.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>statistic = "nwr"</code> Implements the Non-parametric Wind
Regression approach of Henry et al. (2009) that uses kernel smoothers. The
<code>openair</code> implementation is not identical because Gaussian kernels are
used for both wind direction and speed. The smoothing is controlled by
<code>ws_spread</code> and <code>wd_spread</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>statistic = "cpf"</code> the conditional probability function (CPF)
is plotted and a single (usually high) percentile level is supplied. The
CPF is defined as CPF = my/ny, where my is the number of samples in the y
bin (by default a wind direction, wind speed interval) with mixing ratios
greater than the <em>overall</em> percentile concentration, and ny is the
total number of samples in the same wind sector (see Ashbaugh et al.,
1985). Note that percentile intervals can also be considered; see
<code>percentile</code> for details.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> When <code>statistic = "r"</code> or <code>statistic = "Pearson"</code>, the
Pearson correlation coefficient is calculated for <em>two</em> pollutants.
The calculation involves a weighted Pearson correlation coefficient, which
is weighted by Gaussian kernels for wind direction an the radial variable
(by default wind speed). More weight is assigned to values close to a wind
speed-direction interval. Kernel weighting is used to ensure that all data
are used rather than relying on the potentially small number of values in a
wind speed-direction interval.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> When <code>statistic = "Spearman"</code>, the Spearman correlation
coefficient is calculated for <em>two</em> pollutants. The calculation
involves a weighted Spearman correlation coefficient, which is weighted by
Gaussian kernels for wind direction an the radial variable (by default wind
speed). More weight is assigned to values close to a wind speed-direction
interval. Kernel weighting is used to ensure that all data are used rather
than relying on the potentially small number of values in a wind
speed-direction interval.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"robust_slope"</code> is another option for pair-wise statistics and
<code>"quantile.slope"</code>, which uses quantile regression to estimate the
slope for a particular quantile level (see also <code>tau</code> for setting the
quantile level).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"york_slope"</code> is another option for pair-wise statistics which
uses the <em>York regression method</em> to estimate the slope. In this
method the uncertainties in <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are used in the
determination of the slope. The uncertainties are provided by
<code>x_error</code> and <code>y_error</code> — see below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>limits</code></td>
<td>
<p>The function does its best to choose sensible limits
automatically. However, there are circumstances when the user will wish to
set different ones. An example would be a series of plots showing each year
of data separately. The limits are set in the form <code>c(lower, upper)</code>,
so <code>limits = c(0, 100)</code> would force the plot limits to span 0-100.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>exclude.missing</code></td>
<td>
<p>Setting this option to <code>TRUE</code> (the default)
removes points from the plot that are too far from the original data. The
smoothing routines will produce predictions at points where no data exist
i.e. they predict. By removing the points too far from the original data
produces a plot where it is clear where the original data lie. If set to
<code>FALSE</code> missing data will be interpolated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>uncertainty</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should the uncertainty in the calculated surface be shown?
If <code>TRUE</code> three plots are produced on the same scale showing the
predicted surface together with the estimated lower and upper uncertainties
at the 95% confidence interval. Calculating the uncertainties is useful to
understand whether features are real or not.  For example, at high wind
speeds where there are few data there is greater uncertainty over the
predicted values. The uncertainties are calculated using the GAM and
weighting is done by the frequency of measurements in each wind
speed-direction bin. Note that if uncertainties are calculated then the
type is set to "default".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>percentile</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>statistic = "percentile"</code> then <code>percentile</code>
is used, expressed from 0 to 100. Note that the percentile value is
calculated in the wind speed, wind direction ‘bins’. For this reason
it can also be useful to set <code>min.bin</code> to ensure there are a
sufficient number of points available to estimate a percentile. See
<code>quantile</code> for more details of how percentiles are calculated.
</p>
<p><code>percentile</code> is also used for the Conditional Probability Function
(CPF) plots. <code>percentile</code> can be of length two, in which case the
percentile <em>interval</em> is considered for use with CPF. For example,
<code>percentile = c(90, 100)</code> will plot the CPF for concentrations between
the 90 and 100th percentiles. Percentile intervals can be useful for
identifying specific sources. In addition, <code>percentile</code> can also be of
length 3. The third value is the ‘trim’ value to be applied. When
calculating percentile intervals many can cover very low values where there
is no useful information. The trim value ensures that values greater than
or equal to the trim * mean value are considered <em>before</em> the
percentile intervals are calculated. The effect is to extract more detail
from many source signatures. See the manual for examples. Finally, if the
trim value is less than zero the percentile range is interpreted as
absolute concentration values and subsetting is carried out directly.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cols</code></td>
<td>
<p>Colours to be used for plotting. Options include
“default”, “increment”, “heat”, “jet” and
<code>RColorBrewer</code> colours — see the <code>openair</code> <code>openColours</code>
function for more details. For user defined the user can supply a list of
colour names recognised by R (type <code>colours()</code> to see the full list).
An example would be <code>cols = c("yellow", "green", "blue")</code>. <code>cols</code>
can also take the values <code>"viridis"</code>, <code>"magma"</code>,
<code>"inferno"</code>, or <code>"plasma"</code> which are the viridis colour maps
ported from Python's Matplotlib library.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>At the edges of the plot there may only be a few data points
in each wind speed-direction interval, which could in some situations
distort the plot if the concentrations are high. <code>weights</code> applies a
weighting to reduce their influence. For example and by default if only a
single data point exists then the weighting factor is 0.25 and for two
points 0.5. To not apply any weighting and use the data as is, use
<code>weights = c(1, 1, 1)</code>.
</p>
<p>An alternative to down-weighting these points they can be removed
altogether using <code>min.bin</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>min.bin</code></td>
<td>
<p>The minimum number of points allowed in a wind speed/wind
direction bin.  The default is 1. A value of two requires at least 2 valid
records in each bin an so on; bins with less than 2 valid records are set
to NA. Care should be taken when using a value &gt; 1 because of the risk of
removing real data points. It is recommended to consider your data with
care. Also, the <code>polarFreq</code> function can be of use in such
circumstances.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mis.col</code></td>
<td>
<p>When <code>min.bin</code> is &gt; 1 it can be useful to show where data
are removed on the plots. This is done by shading the missing data in
<code>mis.col</code>. To not highlight missing data when <code>min.bin</code> &gt; 1
choose <code>mis.col = "transparent"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>upper</code></td>
<td>
<p>This sets the upper limit wind speed to be used. Often there are
only a relatively few data points at very high wind speeds and plotting all
of them can reduce the useful information in the plot.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>angle.scale</code></td>
<td>
<p>Sometimes the placement of the scale may interfere with an
interesting feature. The user can therefore set <code>angle.scale</code> to any
value between 0 and 360 degrees to mitigate such problems. For example
<code>angle.scale = 45</code> will draw the scale heading in a NE direction.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>units</code></td>
<td>
<p>The units shown on the polar axis scale.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>force.positive</code></td>
<td>
<p>The default is <code>TRUE</code>. Sometimes if smoothing data
with steep gradients it is possible for predicted values to be negative.
<code>force.positive = TRUE</code> ensures that predictions remain positive. This
is useful for several reasons. First, with lots of missing data more
interpolation is needed and this can result in artefacts because the
predictions are too far from the original data. Second, if it is known
beforehand that the data are all positive, then this option carries that
assumption through to the prediction. The only likely time where setting
<code>force.positive = FALSE</code> would be if background concentrations were
first subtracted resulting in data that is legitimately negative. For the
vast majority of situations it is expected that the user will not need to
alter the default option.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
<p>This is the smoothing parameter used by the <code>gam</code> function in
package <code>mgcv</code>. Typically, value of around 100 (the default) seems to
be suitable and will resolve important features in the plot. The most
appropriate choice of <code>k</code> is problem-dependent; but extensive testing
of polar plots for many different problems suggests a value of <code>k</code> of
about 100 is suitable. Setting <code>k</code> to higher values will not tend to
affect the surface predictions by much but will add to the computation
time. Lower values of <code>k</code> will increase smoothing. Sometimes with few
data to plot <code>polarPlot</code> will fail. Under these circumstances it can
be worth lowering the value of <code>k</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>normalise</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code> concentrations are normalised by dividing by
their mean value. This is done <em>after</em> fitting the smooth surface.
This option is particularly useful if one is interested in the patterns of
concentrations for several pollutants on different scales e.g. NOx and CO.
Often useful if more than one <code>pollutant</code> is chosen.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The bivariate polar plot is a useful diagnostic tool for quickly gaining an
idea of potential sources. Wind speed is one of the most useful variables to
use to separate source types (see references). For example, ground-level
concentrations resulting from buoyant plumes from chimney stacks tend to peak
under higher wind speed conditions. Conversely, ground-level, non-buoyant
plumes such as from road traffic, tend to have highest concentrations under
low wind speed conditions. Other sources such as from aircraft engines also
show differing characteristics by wind speed.
</p>
<p>The function has been developed to allow variables other than wind speed to
be plotted with wind direction in polar coordinates. The key issue is that
the other variable plotted against wind direction should be discriminating in
some way. For example, temperature can help reveal high-level sources brought
down to ground level in unstable atmospheric conditions, or show the effect a
source emission dependent on temperature e.g. biogenic isoprene.
</p>
<p>The plots can vary considerably depending on how much smoothing is done.  The
approach adopted here is based on the very flexible and capable <code>mgcv</code>
package that uses <em>Generalized Additive Models</em>. While methods do exist
to find an optimum level of smoothness, they are not necessarily useful. The
principal aim of <code>polarPlot</code> is as a graphical analysis rather than for
quantitative purposes. In this respect the smoothing aims to strike a balance
between revealing interesting (real) features and overly noisy data. The
defaults used in <code>polarPlot()</code> are based on the analysis of data from many
different sources. More advanced users may wish to modify the code and adopt
other smoothing approaches.
</p>
<p>Various statistics are possible to consider e.g. mean, maximum, median.
<code>statistic = "max"</code> is often useful for revealing sources. Pair-wise
statistics between two pollutants can also be calculated.
</p>
<p>The function can also be used to compare two pollutant species through a
range of pair-wise statistics (see help on <code>statistic</code>) and Grange et
al. (2016) (open-access publication link below).
</p>
<p>Wind direction is split up into 10 degree intervals and the other variable
(e.g. wind speed) 30 intervals. These 2D bins are then used to calculate the
statistics.
</p>
<p>These plots often show interesting features at higher wind speeds (see
references below). For these conditions there can be very few measurements
and therefore greater uncertainty in the calculation of the surface. There
are several ways in which this issue can be tackled. First, it is possible to
avoid smoothing altogether and use <code>polarFreq()</code>. Second, the effect of
setting a minimum number of measurements in each wind speed-direction bin can
be examined through <code>min.bin</code>. It is possible that a single point at
high wind speed conditions can strongly affect the surface prediction.
Therefore, setting <code>min.bin = 3</code>, for example, will remove all wind
speed-direction bins with fewer than 3 measurements <em>before</em> fitting the
surface. Third, consider setting <code>uncertainty = TRUE</code>. This option will
show the predicted surface together with upper and lower 95% confidence
intervals, which take account of the frequency of measurements.
</p>
<p>Variants on <code>polarPlot</code> include <code>polarAnnulus()</code> and <code>polarFreq()</code>.
</p>
