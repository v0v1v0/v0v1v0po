<h2>Add maximum targets met objective</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Set the objective of a project prioritization <code>problem()</code> to
maximize the total number of persistence targets met for the features, whilst
ensuring that the cost of the solution is within a pre-specified budget
(Chades <em>et al.</em> 2015). In some project prioritization exercises,
decision makers may have a target level of persistence for each feature
(e.g. a 90% persistence target corresponding to a 90% chance for the
features persisting into the future). In such exercises, the decision makers
do not perceive any benefit when a target is not met (e.g. if a feature
has a persistence target of 90% and a solution only secures a 70% chance
of persistence then no benefit is accrued for that feature) or when a target
is surpassed (e.g. if a feature has a persistence target of 50%, then a
solution which
secures a 95% chance of persistence will accrue the same benefit as a
solution which secures a 50% chance of persistence). Furthermore, weights
can also be used to specify the relative importance of meeting targets
for specific features (see <code>add_feature_weights()</code>).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A problem objective is used to specify the overall goal of the
project prioritization problem.
Here, the maximum targets met objective seeks to find the set of actions
that maximizes the total number of features (e.g. populations, species,
ecosystems) that have met their persistence targets within a
pre-specified budget. Let <code class="reqn">I</code> represent the set of conservation
actions (indexed by <code class="reqn">i</code>). Let <code class="reqn">C_i</code> denote the cost for funding
action <code class="reqn">i</code>, and let <code class="reqn">m</code> denote the maximum expenditure (i.e. the
budget). Also, let <code class="reqn">F</code> represent each feature (indexed by <code class="reqn">f</code>),
<code class="reqn">W_f</code> represent the weight for each feature <code class="reqn">f</code> (defaults to one
for each feature unless specified otherwise), <code class="reqn">T_f</code> represent the
persistence target for each feature <code class="reqn">f</code>, and <code class="reqn">E_f</code> denote the
probability that each feature will go extinct given the funded
conservation projects.
</p>
<p>To guide the prioritization, the conservation actions are organized into
conservation projects. Let <code class="reqn">J</code> denote the set of conservation projects
(indexed by <code class="reqn">j</code>), and let <code class="reqn">A_{ij}</code> denote which actions
<code class="reqn">i \in I</code> comprise each conservation project
<code class="reqn">j \in J</code> using zeros and ones. Next, let <code class="reqn">P_j</code> represent
the probability of project <code class="reqn">j</code> being successful if it is funded. Also,
let <code class="reqn">B_{fj}</code> denote the enhanced probability that each feature
<code class="reqn">f \in F</code> associated with the project <code class="reqn">j \in J</code>
will persist if all of the actions that comprise project <code class="reqn">j</code> are funded
and that project is allocated to feature <code class="reqn">f</code>.
For convenience,
let <code class="reqn">Q_{fj}</code> denote the actual probability that each
<code class="reqn">f \in F</code> associated with the project <code class="reqn">j \in J</code>
is expected to persist if the project is funded. If the argument
to <code>adjust_for_baseline</code> in the <code>problem</code> function was set to
<code>TRUE</code>, and this is the default behavior, then
<code class="reqn">Q_{fj} = (P_{j} \times B_{fj}) + \bigg(\big(1 - (P_{j} B_{fj})\big)
  \times (P_{n} \times B_{fn})\bigg)</code>, where <code>n</code> corresponds to the
baseline "do nothing" project. This means that the probability
of a feature persisting if a project is allocated to a feature
depends on (i) the probability of the project succeeding, (ii) the
probability of the feature persisting if the project does not fail,
and (iii) the probability of the feature persisting even if the project
fails. Otherwise, if the argument is set to <code>FALSE</code>, then
<code class="reqn">Q_{fj} = P_{j} \times B_{fj}</code>.
</p>
<p>The binary control variables <code class="reqn">X_i</code> in this problem indicate whether
each project <code class="reqn">i \in I</code> is funded or not. The decision
variables in this problem are the <code class="reqn">Y_{j}</code>, <code class="reqn">Z_{fj}</code>, <code class="reqn">E_f</code>,
and <code class="reqn">G_f</code> variables.
Specifically, the binary <code class="reqn">Y_{j}</code> variables indicate if project <code class="reqn">j</code>
is funded or not based on which actions are funded; the binary
<code class="reqn">Z_{fj}</code> variables indicate if project <code class="reqn">j</code> is used to manage
feature <code class="reqn">f</code> or not; the semi-continuous <code class="reqn">E_f</code> variables
denote the probability that feature <code class="reqn">f</code> will go extinct; and the
<code class="reqn">G_f</code> variables indicate if the persistence target for feature
<code class="reqn">f</code> is met.
</p>
<p>Now that we have defined all the data and variables, we can formulate
the problem. For convenience, let the symbol used to denote each set also
represent its cardinality (e.g. if there are ten features, let <code class="reqn">F</code>
represent the set of ten features and also the number ten).

<p>The objective (eqn 1a) is to maximize the weighted total number of the
features that have their persistence targets met.
Constraints (eqn 1b) calculate which persistence targets have been met.
Constraint (eqn 1c) limits the maximum expenditure (i.e. ensures
that the cost of the funded actions do not exceed the budget).
Constraints (eqn 1d) calculate the probability that each feature
will go extinct according to their allocated project.
Constraints (eqn 1e) ensure that feature can only be allocated to projects
that have all of their actions funded. Constraints (eqn 1f) state that each
feature can only be allocated to a single project. Constraints (eqn 1g)
ensure that a project cannot be funded unless all of its actions are funded.
Constraints (eqns 1h) ensure that the probability variables
(<code class="reqn">E_f</code>) are bounded between zero and one. Constraints (eqns 1i) ensure
that the target met (<code class="reqn">G_f</code>), action funding (<code class="reqn">X_i</code>), project funding
(<code class="reqn">Y_j</code>), and project allocation (<code class="reqn">Z_{fj}</code>) variables are binary.
