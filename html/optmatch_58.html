<h2>Create treated to control distances for matching problems</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A function with which to produce matching distances, for instance Mahalanobis
distances, propensity score discrepancies or calipers, or combinations
thereof, for <code>pairmatch</code> or <code>fullmatch</code> to
subsequently “match on”.  Conceptually, the result of a call
<code>match_on</code> is a treatment-by-control matrix of distances.  Because these
matrices can grow quite large, in practice <code>match_on</code> produces either an
ordinary dense matrix or a special sparse matrix structure (that can make use
of caliper and exact matching constraints to reduce storage requirements).
Methods are supplied for these sparse structures,
<code>InfinitySparseMatrix</code>es, so that they can be manipulated and modified
in much the same way as dense matrices.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>match_on</code> is generic. There are several supplied methods, all providing
the same basic output: a matrix (or similar) object with treated units on the
rows and control units on the columns. Each cell [i,j] then indicates the
distance from a treated unit i to control unit j. Entries that are <code>Inf</code>
are said to be unmatchable. Such units are guaranteed to never be in a
matched set. For problems with many <code>Inf</code> entries, so called sparse
matching problems, <code>match_on</code> uses a special data type that is more
space efficient than a standard R <code>matrix</code>.  When problems are not
sparse (i.e. dense), <code>match_on</code> uses the standard <code>matrix</code> type.
</p>
<p><code>match_on</code> methods differ on the types of arguments they take, making
the function a one-stop location of many different ways of specifying
matches: using functions, formulas, models, and even simple scores. Many of
the methods require additional arguments, detailed below. All methods take a
<code>within</code> argument, a distance specification made using
<code>exactMatch</code> or <code>caliper</code> (or some additive
combination of these or other distance creating functions). All
<code>match_on</code> methods will use the finite entries in the <code>within</code>
argument as a guide for producing the new distance. Any entry that is
<code>Inf</code> in <code>within</code> will be <code>Inf</code> in the distance matrix
returned by <code>match_on</code>. This argument can reduce the processing time
needed to compute sparse distance matrices.
</p>
<p>Details for each particular first type of argument follow:
</p>
<p><b>First argument (<code>x</code>): <code>glm</code>.</b> The model is assumed to be
a fitted propensity score model. From this it extracts distances on the
<em>linear</em> propensity score: fitted values of the linear predictor, the
link function applied to the estimated conditional probabilities, as opposed
to the estimated conditional probabilities themselves (Rosenbaum &amp; Rubin,
1985).  For example, a logistic model (<code>glm</code> with
<code>family=binomial()</code>) has the logit function as its link, so from such
models <code>match_on</code> computes distances in terms of logits of the
estimated conditional probabilities, i.e. the estimated log odds.
</p>
<p>Optionally these distances are also rescaled. The default is to rescale, by
the reciprocal of an outlier-resistant variant of the pooled s.d. of
propensity scores; see <code>standardization_scale</code>.  (The
<code>standardization.scale</code> argument of this function can be used to
change how this dispersion is calculated, e.g. to calculate an ordinary not
an outlier-resistant s.d.; it will be passed down
to <code>standardization_scale</code> as its <code>standardizer</code> argument.)
To skip rescaling, set argument <code>standardization.scale</code> to 1.
The overall result records
absolute differences between treated and control units on linear, possibly
rescaled, propensity scores.
</p>
<p>In addition, one can impose a caliper in terms of these distances by
providing a scalar as a <code>caliper</code> argument, forbidding matches between
treatment and control units differing in the calculated propensity score by
more than the specified caliper.  For example, Rosenbaum and Rubin's (1985)
caliper of one-fifth of a pooled propensity score s.d. would be imposed by
specifying <code>caliper=.2</code>, in tandem either with the default rescaling
or, to follow their example even more closely, with the additional
specification <code>standardization.scale=sd</code>. Propensity calipers are
beneficial computationally as well as statistically, for reasons indicated
in the below discussion of the <code>numeric</code> method.
</p>
<p>One can also specify exactMatching criteria by using <code>strata(foo)</code> inside
the formula to build the <code>glm</code>. For example, passing
<code>glm(y ~ x + strata(s))</code> to <code>match_on</code> is equivalent to passing
<code>within=exactMatch(y ~ strata(s))</code>. Note that when combining with
the <code>caliper</code> argument, the standard deviation used for the caliper will be
computed across all strata, not within each strata.
</p>
<p>If data used to fit the glm have missing values in the left-hand side
(dependent) variable, these observations are omitted from the output of
match_on.  If there are observations with missing values in right hand
side (independent) variables, then a re-fit of the model after imputing
these variables using a simple scheme and adding indicator variables of
missingness will be attempted, via the <code>scores</code> function.
</p>
<p><b>First argument (<code>x</code>): <code>bigglm</code>.</b> This method works
analogously to the <code>glm</code> method, but with <code>bigglm</code> objects,
created by the <code>bigglm</code> function from package ‘biglm’, which
can handle bigger data sets than the ordinary glm function can.
</p>
<p><b>First argument (<code>x</code>): <code>formula</code>.</b> The formula must have
<code>Z</code>, the treatment indicator (<code>Z=0</code> indicates control group,
<code>Z=1</code> indicates treatment group), on the left hand side, and any
variables to compute a distance on on the right hand side. E.g. <code>Z ~ X1
  + X2</code>. The Mahalanobis distance is calculated as the square root of d'Cd,
where d is the vector of X-differences on a pair of observations and C is an
inverse (generalized inverse) of the pooled covariance of Xes. (The pooling
is of the covariance of X within the subset defined by <code>Z==0</code> and
within the complement of that subset. This is similar to a Euclidean
distance calculated after reexpressing the Xes in standard units, such that
the reexpressed variables all have pooled SDs of 1; except that it addresses
redundancies among the variables by scaling down variables contributions in
proportion to their correlations with other included variables.)
</p>
<p>Euclidean distance is also available, via <code>method="euclidean"</code>, and
ranked, Mahalanobis distance, via <code>method="rank_mahalanobis"</code>.
</p>
<p>The treatment indicator <code>Z</code> as noted above must either be numeric
(1 representing treated units and 0 control units) or logical
(<code>TRUE</code> for treated, <code>FALSE</code> for controls). (Earlier versions of
the software accepted factor variables and other types of numeric variable; you
may have to update existing scripts to get them to run.)
</p>
<p>As an alternative to specifying a <code>within</code> argument, when <code>x</code> is
a formula, the <code>strata</code> command can be used inside the formula to specify
exact matching. For example, rather than using <code>within=exactMatch(y ~
  z, data=data)</code>, you may update your formula as <code>y ~ x + strata(z)</code>. Do
not use both methods (<code>within</code> and <code>strata</code> simultaneously. Note
that when combining with the <code>caliper</code> argument, the standard
deviation used for the caliper will be computed across all strata, not
separately by stratum.
</p>
<p>A unit with NA treatment status (<code>Z</code>) is ignored and will not be included in the distance output.
Missing values in variables on the right hand side of the formula are handled as follows. By default
<code>match_on</code> will (1) create a matrix of distances between observations which
have only valid values for **all** covariates and then (2) append matrices of Inf values
for distances between observations either of which has a missing values on any of the right-hand-side variables.
(I.e., observations with missing values are retained in the output, but
matches involving them are forbidden.)
</p>
<p><b>First argument (<code>x</code>): <code>function</code>.</b> The passed function
must take arguments: <code>index</code>, <code>data</code>, and <code>z</code>. The
<code>data</code> and <code>z</code> arguments will be the same as those passed directly
to <code>match_on</code>. The <code>index</code> argument is a matrix of two columns,
representing the pairs of treated and control units that are valid
comparisons (given any <code>within</code> arguments). The first column is the row
name or id of the treated unit in the <code>data</code> object. The second column
is the id for the control unit, again in the <code>data</code> object. For each of
these pairs, the function should return the distance between the treated
unit and control unit.  This may sound complicated, but is simple to
use. For example, a function that returned the absolute difference between
two units using a vector of data would be <code> f &lt;- function(index, data,
  z) { abs(data[index[,1]] - data[index[,2]]) } </code>.  (Note: This simple case is
precisely handled by the <code>numeric</code> method.)
</p>
<p><b>First argument (<code>x</code>): <code>numeric</code>.</b> This returns
absolute differences between treated and control units' values of <code>x</code>.
If a caliper is specified, pairings with <code>x</code>-differences greater than
it are forbidden.  Conceptually, those distances are set to <code>Inf</code>;
computationally, if either of <code>caliper</code> and <code>within</code> has been
specified then only information about permissible pairings will be stored,
so the forbidden pairings are simply omitted. Providing a <code>caliper</code>
argument here, as opposed to omitting it and afterward applying the
<code>caliper</code> function, reduces storage requirements and may
otherwise improve performance, particularly in larger problems.
</p>
<p>For the numeric method, <code>x</code> must have names. If <code>z</code> is named
it must have the same names as <code>x</code>, though it allows for a different
ordering of names. <code>x</code>'s name ordering is considered canonical.
</p>
<p><b>First argument (<code>x</code>): <code>matrix</code> or <code>InfinitySparseMatrix</code>.</b> These just return their
arguments as these objects are already valid distance specifications.
</p>
