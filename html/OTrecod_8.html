<p>A. THE RECODING PROBLEM IN DATA FUSION
</p>
<p>Assuming that <code class="reqn">Y</code> and <code class="reqn">Z</code> are two variables which refered to the same target population in two separate databases A and B respectively (no overlapping rows),
so that <code class="reqn">Y</code> and <code class="reqn">Z</code> are never jointly observed. Assuming also that A and B share a subset of common covariates <code class="reqn">X</code> of any types (same encodings in A and B)
completed or not. Integrating these two databases often requires to solve the recoding problem by creating an unique database where
the missing information of <code class="reqn">Y</code> and <code class="reqn">Z</code> is fully completed.
</p>
<p>B. DESCRIPTION OF THE FUNCTION
</p>
<p>The function <code>indiv_grp_closest</code> is an intermediate function used in the implementation of an algorithm called OUTCOME (and its enrichment R-OUTCOME, see the reference (2) for more details) dedicated to the solving of recoding problems in data fusion using Optimal Transportation theory.
The model is implemented in the function <code>OT_outcome</code> which integrates the function <code>indiv_grp_closest</code> in its syntax as a possible second step of the algorithm.
The function <code>indiv_grp_closest</code> can also be used separately provided that the argument <code>proxim</code> receives an output object of the function <code>proxim_dist</code>.
This latter is available in the package and is so directly usable beforehand.
</p>
<p>The algorithms <code>OUTCOME</code> (and <code>R-OUTCOME</code>) are made of two independent parts. Assuming that the objective consists in the prediction of <code class="reqn">Z</code> in the database A:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The first part of the algorithm solves the optimization problem by providing a solution called <code class="reqn">\gamma</code> that corresponds here to an estimation of the joint distribution <code class="reqn">(Y,Z)</code> in A.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> From the first part, a nearest neighbor procedure is carried out as a second part to provide the individual predictions of <code class="reqn">Z</code> in A: this procedure is implemented in the function <code>indiv_group_closest</code>.
In other words, this function sequentially assigns to each individual of A the modality of <code class="reqn">Z</code> that is closest.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, this algorithm  runs in the same way for the prediction of <code class="reqn">Y</code> in the database B.
The function <code>indiv_grp_closest</code> integrates in its syntax the function <code>avg_dist_closest</code>. Therefore, the related argument <code>percent_closest</code> is identical in the two functions.
Thus, when computing average distances between an individual <code class="reqn">i</code> and a subset of individuals assigned to a same level of <code class="reqn">Y</code> or <code class="reqn">Z</code> is required, user can decide if all individuals from the subset of interest can participate to the computation (<code>percent_closest</code>=1) or only a fixed part p (&lt;1) corresponding to the closest neighbors of <code class="reqn">i</code> (in this case <code>percent_closest</code> = p).
</p>
<p>The arguments <code>jointprobaA</code> and <code>jointprobaB</code> correspond to the estimations of <code class="reqn">\gamma</code> (sum of cells must be equal to 1) in A and/or B respectively, according to the <code>which.DB</code> argument.
For example, assuming that <code class="reqn">n_{Y_1}</code> individuals are assigned to the first modality of <code class="reqn">Y</code> in A, the objective consists in the individual predictions of <code class="reqn">Z</code> in A. Then, if <code>jointprobaA</code>[1,2] = 0.10,
the maximum number of individuals that can be assigned to the second modality of <code class="reqn">Z</code> in A, can not exceed <code class="reqn">0.10 \times n_A</code>.
If <code class="reqn">n_{Y_1} \leq 0.10 \times n_A</code> then all individuals assigned to the first modality of <code class="reqn">Y</code> will be assigned to the second modality of <code class="reqn">Z</code>.
At the end of the process, each individual with still no affectation  will receive the same modality of <code class="reqn">Z</code> as those of his nearest neighbor in B.

### Y(Yb1) and Z(Yb2) are a same information encoded in 2 different forms:

### ... Stored in two distinct databases, A and B, respectively
### The marginal distribution of Y in B is unknown,

# Empirical distribution of Y in database A:
freqY &lt;- prop.table(table(man1$Y))
freqY

# Empirical distribution of Z in database B
freqZ &lt;- prop.table(table(man1$Z))
freqZ

# By supposing that the following matrix called transport symbolizes
# an estimation of the joint distribution L(Y,Z) ...
# Note that, in reality this distribution is UNKNOWN and is
# estimated in the OT function by resolving an optimisation problem.

# ... So that the marginal distributions of this object corresponds to freqY and freqZ:
apply(transport1, 1, sum) # = freqY
apply(transport1, 2, sum) # = freqZ

# The affectation of the predicted values of Y in database B and Z in database A
