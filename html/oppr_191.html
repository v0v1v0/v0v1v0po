<h2>Problem solvers</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Specify the software and configuration used to solve a project prioritization
<code>problem()</code>. By default, the best available exact algorithm
solver will be used.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The following solvers can be used to find solutions for a
project prioritization <code>problem()</code>:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>add_default_solver()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This solver uses the best software
currently installed on the system.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>add_gurobi_solver()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p><a href="https://www.gurobi.com"><em>Gurobi</em></a>
is a state-of-the-art commercial optimization software with an R package
interface. It is by far the fastest solver that can be used by
this package, however, it is also the only solver that is not freely
available. That said, licenses are available to academics at no cost. The
<span class="pkg">gurobi</span> package is distributed with the <em>Gurobi</em> software
suite. This solver uses the <span class="pkg">gurobi</span> package to solve problems.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>add_rsymphony_solver()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p><a href="https://github.com/coin-or/SYMPHONY"><em>SYMPHONY</em></a> is an
open-source integer programming solver that is part of the Computational
Infrastructure for Operations Research (COIN-OR) project, an initiative
to promote development of open-source tools for operations research (a
field that includes linear programming). The <span class="pkg">Rsymphony</span> package
provides an interface to COIN-OR and is available on CRAN. This solver
uses the <span class="pkg">Rsymphony</span> package to solve problems.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>add_lpsymphony_solver()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <span class="pkg">lpsymphony</span> package
provides a different interface to the COIN-OR software suite. Unlike the
<span class="pkg">Rsymhpony</span> package, the <span class="pkg">lpsymphony</span> package is distributed
through
<a href="https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.lpsymphony">Bioconductor</a>.
The <span class="pkg">lpsymphony</span> package may be easier to install on Windows or
Max OSX systems than the <span class="pkg">Rsymphony</span> package.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>add_lpsolveapi_solver()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p><a href="http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/"><em>lp_solve</em></a> is an
open-source integer programming solver. The <span class="pkg">lpSolveAPI</span> package
provides an interface to this solver and is available on CRAN.
Although this solver is the slowest currently supported solver,
it is also the only exact algorithm solver that can be installed on all
operating systems without any manual installation steps.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>add_heuristic_solver()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Generate solutions using
a backwards heuristic algorithm. Although these types of algorithms have
conventionally been used to solve project prioritization problems,
they are extremely unlikely to identify optimal solutions and provide
no guarantees concerning solution quality.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>add_random_solver()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Generate solutions by
randomly funding actions. This can be useful when evaluating the
performance of a funding schemeâ€”though it is strongly recommended
to evaluate the performance of a funding scheme by comparing it
to an optimal solution identified using exact algorithms (e.g.
<code>add_gurobi_solver()</code>, <code>add_rsymphony_solver()</code>).</p>
