<h2>
Filter Taxa Based on Abundance and Persistence
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Returns a table containing only taxa that meet the imposed requirements of a minimum abundance and a minimum number of samples containing that taxon
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">filter_taxa(table, abundance, persistence)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>table</code></td>
<td>

<p>A table containing the relative abundances of each OTU or taxon in the form produced by clean_shared(). Can be used on the output of grab_groups() or combine_otus()
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>abundance</code></td>
<td>

<p>The minimum threshold for percentage of reads attributed to a taxon in at least one sample. Taxa at abundances greater than or equal this number will be retained.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>persistence</code></td>
<td>

<p>The minimum threshold for the percentage of samples in which a taxon has been observed.  Taxa at abundances greater than or equal this number will be retained.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a table with all taxa that met the imposed thresholds
</p>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# To make a table containing only OTUs with at least 0.1% abundance 
# in at least one sample that were observed

# To make a table containing only phyla with at least 10% abundance 
# in any one sample and were observed
