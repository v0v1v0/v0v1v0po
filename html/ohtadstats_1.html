<h2>Chicken Genotype Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This file is a matrix of genotypes from 96 chickens encompassing 5 breeds,
genotyped as part of the Synbreed Project. Individuals are in rows. Marker genotypes
are in columns, coded as 0, 1, and 2. Row names are a breed index so all rows named "1"
are from breed 1, all rows named "2" are from breed 2, and so on. Column names are
marker names. These data are a subset of the data used by Beissinger et al. (2016).
The full dataset is hosted on Figshare at the which can be at the
