<h2>Active Connection</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function gets or sets the currently active connection to an openEO service. Usually, the
active connection is set when calling the <code>connect()</code> function. Just the last
connection is set as active.
An application for the active connection is the optional connection within all the functions
that interact with the openEO service and require a connection. If the connection is omitted
in the function, this function is called in order to try to fetch a connection. If you
want to operate on multiple services at once, you should use an explicit connection.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
# Note: all URLs and credentials are arbitrary
con1 = connect("https://first.openeo-backend.com")
con2 = connect("https://second.openeo-backend.com")

active_connection() # this will be con2, the last connected backend

active_connection(con = con1) # sets the first connection as active, so it does not have to 
# be passed to all functions

active_connection() # this will now return the previous set connection con1

## End(Not run)
