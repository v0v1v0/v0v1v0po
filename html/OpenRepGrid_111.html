<h2>Implicative Dilemmas</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implicative dilemmas are closely related to the notion of conflict. An implicative dilemma arises when a desired
change on one construct is associated with an undesired implication on another construct. E. g. a timid subject may
want to become more socially skilled but associates being socially skilled with different negative characteristics
(selfish, insensitive etc.). Hence, he may anticipate that becoming less timid will also make him more selfish (cf.
Winter, 1982). As a consequence, the subject will resist to the change if the negative presumed implications will
threaten the patients identity and the predictive power of his construct system. From this stance the resistance to
change is a logical consequence coherent with the subjects construct system (Feixas, Saul, &amp; Sanchez, 2000). The
investigation of the role of cognitive dilemma in different disorders in the context of PCP is a current field of
research (e.g. Feixas &amp; Saul, 2004, Dorough et al. 2007).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The detection of implicative dilemmas happens in two steps. First the constructs are classified as being 'congruent'
or 'discrepant'. Secondly, the correlation between a congruent and discrepant construct pair is assessed if it is
big enough to indicate an implication.
</p>
<p><strong>Classifying the construct</strong>
</p>
<p>To detect implicit dilemmas the construct pairs are first identified as 'congruent' or 'discrepant'. The assessment
is based on the rating differences between the elements 'self' and 'ideal self'. A construct is 'congruent' if the
construction of the 'self' and the preferred state (i.e. ideal self) are the same or similar. A construct is
discrepant if the construction of the 'self' and the 'ideal' is dissimilar.
</p>
<p>There are two popular accepted methods to identify congruent and discrepant constructs:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> "Scale Midpoint criterion" (cf. Grice 2008)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "Minimal and maximal score difference" (cf. Feixas &amp; Saul, 2004)
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>"Scale Midpoint criterion" (cf. Grice 2008)</em>
</p>
<p>As reported in the Idiogrid (v. 2.4) manual: "... The Scale Midpoint uses the scales as the 'dividing line' for
discrepancies; for example, if the actual element is rated above the midpoint, then the discrepancy exists (and vice
versa). If the two selves are the same as the actual side of the scale, then a discrepancy does not exist". As an
example:
</p>
<p>Assuming a scoring range of 1-7, the midpoint score will be 4, we then look at self and ideal-self scoring on any
given construct and we proceed as follow:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> If the scoring of Self AND Ideal Self are both &lt; 4: construct is "Congruent"
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If the scoring of Self AND Ideal Self are both &gt; 4: construct is "Congruent"
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If the scoring of Self is &lt; 4 AND Ideal Self is &gt; 4 (OR vice versa): construct is "discrepant"
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If scoring Self OR Ideal Self = 4 then the construct is NOT Discrepant and it is "Undifferentiated"
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Minimal and maximal score difference criterion (cf. Feixas &amp; Saul, 2004)</em>
</p>
<p>This other method is more conservative and it is designed to minimize Type I errors by a) setting a default minimum
correlation between constructs of <code>r=.34</code>; b) discarding cases where the ideal Self and self are neither congruent
or discrepant; c) discarding cases where ideal self is "not oriented", i.e. scored at the midpoint.
</p>
<p>E.g. suppose the element 'self' is rated 2 and 'ideal self' 5 on a scale from 1 to 6. The ratings differences are
5-2 = 3. If this difference is smaller than e.g. 1 the construct is 'congruent', if it is bigger than 3 it is
'discrepant'.
</p>
<p>The values used to classify the constructs 'congruent' or 'discrepant' can be determined in several ways (cf. Bell,
2009):
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> They are set 'a priori'.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> They are implicitly derived by taking into account the rating
differences to the other constructs. (Not yet implemented)
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The value mode is determined via the argument <code>diff.mode</code>.
</p>
<p>If no 'a priori' criteria to determine whether the construct is congruent or discrepant is supplied as an argument,
the values are chosen according to the range of the rating scale used. For the following scales the defaults are
chosen as:</p>

<p><strong>Defining the correlations</strong>
</p>
<p>As the implications between constructs cannot be derived from a rating grid directly, the correlation between two
constructs is used as an indicator for implication. A large correlation means that one construct pole implies the
other. A small correlation indicates a lack of implication. The minimum criterion for a correlation to indicate
implication is set to .35 (cf. Feixas &amp; Saul, 2004). The user may also choose another value. To get a an impression
of the distribution of correlations in the grid, a visualization can be prompted via the argument <code>show</code>. When
calculating the correlation used to assess if an implication is given or not, the elements under consideration (i.
e. self and ideal self) can be included (default) or excluded. The options will cause different correlations (see
argument <code>exclude</code>).
</p>
<p><strong>Example of an implicative dilemma</strong>
</p>
<p>A depressive person considers herself as 'timid' and wished to change to the opposite pole she defines as
'extraverted'. This construct is called discrepant as the construction of the 'self' and the desired state (e.g.
described by the 'ideal self') on this construct differ. The person also considers herself as 'sensitive' (preferred
pole) for which the opposite pole is 'selfish'. This construct is congruent, as the person construes herself as she
would like to be. If the person now changed on the discrepant construct from the undesired to the desired pole, i.e.
from timid to extraverted, the question can be asked what consequences such a change has. If the person construes
being timid and being sensitive as related and that someone who is extraverted will not be timid, a change on the
first construct will imply a change on the congruent construct as well. Hence, the positive shift from timid to
extraverted is presumed to have a undesired effect in moving from sensitive towards selfish. This relation is called
an implicative dilemma. As the implications of change on a construct cannot be derived from a rating grid directly,
the correlation between two constructs is used as an indicator of implication.
