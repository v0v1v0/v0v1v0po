<h2>Subcascades Evaluation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>Subcascades</code> returns all cascades found within the data or evaluates a set of specific cascades.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">subcascades(
  predictionMap = NULL,
  sets = NULL,
  thresh = 0,
  size = NA,
  numSol = 1000
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>predictionMap</code></td>
<td>
<p>A PredictionMap object as it is returned by <code>predictionMap</code>-function. 
It is made up of a list of two matrices(pred and meta). Both matrices provide information on individual samples column-wise.
The rownames of the pred-matrix (e.g. [0vs1]) show the classes of the binary base classifier. The elements are the prediction result of a specific training.
The rows that correspond to base classifiers that would separate the same class consists of -1. Those rows are not used within the analysis.
The meta information connects the values in the pred-matrix to a specific fold, run and contains the original label.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sets</code></td>
<td>
<p>Contains the set used for filtering. It is either a list of numeric vectors, a numeric vector, 
or a vector of characters representing a cascade of the following format '1&gt;2&gt;4'. Empty vectors are not allowed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>thresh</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric value between 0 and 1.
The minimal sensitivity threshold used to filter the returned cascades. 
Only cascades that pass this threshold are returned. 
If 0 is used the returned cascades are filtered for &gt;0 and otherwise &gt;= thresh.
For low thresholds the calculation lasts longer.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>size</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric value that defines the size of the cascades that should be returned. 
The smallest size is 2 and the largest the maximal number of classes of the current dataset.
If size is NA (the default setting), all cascades from 2 to the maximal number of classes are evaluated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>numSol</code></td>
<td>
<p>The maximum number of cascades that should pass the first sensitivity bound and are 
further evaluated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function can either be used to evaluate the performance of a specific cascade, a set of cascades or 
to filter out the set of cascades of a specific size and passing a given threshold. 
If the sets-variable is given no size can be set.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A Subcascades object comprising the evaluated cascades and their performances. 
The Subcascades object is made up of a list of matrices. 
Each matrix comprises the evaluation results of cascades of a specific length and 
is sorted row-wise according to the achieved minimal classwise sensitivities of the cascades (decreasing).
The rownames show the class order by a character string of type '1&gt;2&gt;3' and the entries the sensitivity for each position of the cascade.
