<h2>Identification of units placed into matched sets</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a bipartite matching (object of class <code>optmatch</code>),
create a logical vector of the same length indicating which units
were and were not placed into matched sets.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">matched(x)

unmatched()

matchfailed(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector of class <code>optmatch</code> (especially as generated
by a call to <code>fullmatch</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>matched</code> and <code>unmatched</code> indicate which elements of
<code>x</code> do and do not belong to matched sets, as indicated by
their character representations in <code>x</code>.
</p>
<p>When <code>fullmatch</code> has been presented with an inconsistent
combination of constraints and discrepancies between potential
matches, so that there exists no matching (i) with finite total
discrepancy within matched sets that (ii) respects the given
constraints, then the matching problem is said to be infeasible.
<code>TRUE</code>s in the output of <code>matchfailed</code> indicate that
this has occurred.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A logical vector (without names).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>To understand the output of <code>matchfailed</code> element-wise,
note that <code>fullmatch</code> handles a matching problem in three
steps.  First, if <code>fullmatch</code> has been directed to match
within subclasses, then it divides its matching problem into a
subproblem for each subclass.  Second, <code>fullmatch</code> removes
from each subproblem those individual units that lack
permissible potential matches (i.e. potential matches from which
they are separated by a finite discrepancy).  Such "isolated"
units are flagged in such a way as to be indicated by
<code>unmatched</code>, but not by <code>matchfailed</code>.  Third,
<code>fullmatch</code> presents each subproblem, with isolated
elements removed, to an optimal matching routine.  If such a
reduced subproblem is found at this stage to be infeasible, then
each unit contributing to it is so flagged as to be indicated by
<code>matchfailed</code>.
