<h2>Uncertainty index</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A measure for the degree of dispersion of dependency in a dependency grid (Bell, 2001). It is normalized measure
with a value range between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>. The index is applicable to dependency grids (e.g., situation-resource) only,
i.e., all grid ratings must be <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">indexUncertainty(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>repgrid</code> object with <code>0</code>/<code>1</code> ratings only, where <code>1</code> indicates a dependency.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><strong>Theoretical Background</strong>: <em>Dispersion of Dependency</em>: Kelly (1969) proposed that it is problematic to view people
as either <em>independent</em> or <em>dependent</em> because everyone is, to greater or lesser degrees, dependent upon others in
life. What Kelly felt was important was how well people disperse their dependencies across different people. Whereas
young children tend to have their dependencies concentrated on a  small number of people (typically parents), adults
are more likely to spread their dependencies across a variety of others. Dispersing one's dependencies is generally
considered more psychologically adjusted for adults (Walker et al., 1988).
