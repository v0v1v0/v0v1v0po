<h2>Dispersion of dependency index (DDI)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Measures the degree of dispersion of dependency in a situation-resource grid (dependency grid), i.e. the degree to
which a person dispersed critical situations over resource persons (Walker et al., 1988, p. 66). The index is a
renamed adoption of the <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠diversity index⁠</code> from the field of ecology where it is used to measure the diversity of
species in a sample. Both are computationally identical. The index is applicable to dependency grids (e.g.,
situation-resource) only, i.e., all grid ratings must be <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">indexDDI(x, ds)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>repgrid</code> object with <code>0</code>/<code>1</code> ratings only, where <code>1</code> indicates a dependency.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ds</code></td>
<td>
<p>Predetermined size of sample of dependencies.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><em>Caveat</em>: The DDI depends on the chosen sample size <code>ds</code>. Also, its measurement range is not normalized between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>,
allowing only comparison between similarly sized grids (see Bell, 2001).
</p>
<p><strong>Theoretical Background</strong>:  <em>Dispersion of Dependency</em>: Kelly (1969) proposed that it is problematic to view people
as either <em>independent</em> or <em>dependent</em> because everyone is, to greater or lesser degrees, dependent upon others in
life. What Kelly felt was important was how well people disperse their dependencies across different people. Whereas
young children tend to have their dependencies concentrated on a  small number of people (typically parents), adults
are more likely to spread their dependencies across a variety of others. Dispersing one's dependencies is generally
considered more psychologically adjusted for adults (Walker et al., 1988).
