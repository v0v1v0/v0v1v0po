<h2>Targets</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Targets are used to specify the minimum probability of persistence required
for each feature. Please note that only some objectives require
targets, and attempting to solve a problem that requires targets will throw
an error if targets are not supplied, and attempting to solve a problem that
does not require targets will throw a warning if targets are supplied.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The following functions can be used to specify targets for a
project prioritization <code>problem()</code>:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>add_relative_targets()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Set targets as a proportion (between 0 and 1) of the maximum probability
of persistence associated with the best project for each feature. For
instance, if the best project for a feature has an 80% probability of
persisting, setting a 50% (i.e. <code>0.5</code>) relative target will
correspond to a 40% threshold probability of persisting.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>add_absolute_targets()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Set targets by specifying exactly what probability of persistence is
required for each feature. For instance, setting an absolute target of
10% (i.e. <code>0.1</code>) corresponds to a threshold 10% probability of
persisting.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>add_manual_targets()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Set targets by manually specifying all the required information for each
target.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
