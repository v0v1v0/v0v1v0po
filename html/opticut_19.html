<h2>
Bird Species Detections
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data set listing 156 species (mostly birds, few amphibians and mammals) detected
at 127 sites (367 point locations) in Alberta, Canada in 2015,
using autonomous recording technology (ARU; Wildlife Acoustic Song Meter)
for sound recordings.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("birdrec")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list with 3 elements with matching ordering:
<code>xtab</code> is a sample x species matrix with number of detections,
<code>samp</code> is a data frame with sample level attributes.
<code>taxa</code> is a data frame with species level attributes.
</p>
<p>Multiple random recordings at each location were selected
according to a stratified random design
(based on combination of <code>TOY</code> and <code>TOD</code>).
These recordings were listened to by trained analysts
and species were identified based on auditory cues.
</p>
<p>This data set lists detections from the first 1-minute segment of each
recording. Dates for the 3967 1-minute segments
range between 2015-03-31 and 2015-07-29.
Variables in <code>birdrec$samp</code> are the following:
</p>
<p><code>PKEY</code>: primary key for location/time combinations.
</p>
<p><code>POINT</code>: unique spatial location IDs, each point had
its own ARU unit.
</p>
<p><code>SITE</code>: site ID (1-4 ARU units deployed per site).
</p>
<p><code>YEAR</code>: year, 2015.
</p>
<p><code>MONTH</code>: month from 3 (March) to 7 (July).
</p>
<p><code>MDAY</code>: day of month, 1-31.
</p>
<p><code>HOUR</code>: 24-hour of day, values between 0-12.
</p>
<p><code>MINUTE</code>: minute, 0-59.
</p>
<p><code>YDAY</code>: ordinal day of the year, 89-209.
</p>
<p><code>RAIN</code>, <code>WIND</code>, <code>INDUSTRY</code>, <code>NOISE</code>:
level of rain, wind, industrial noise, and background noise.
0 = no; 1 = light; 2 = moderate; 3 = heavy.
</p>
<p><code>MICROPHONE</code>:
Every recording contains a certain level of background static due to the
pre-amplifiers; however, problems, such as, electrostatic discharge on the
microphones, faulty wiring, poorly installed microphones and/or
missing microphones can occur causing excess static or dead channels.
0 = no microphone related issues;
1 = left microphone cuts out intermittently;
2 = right microphone cuts out intermittently;
3 = both microphones cut out intermittently;
4 = left channel failed;
5 = right channel failed;
6 = both channels failed (no cases in the data set);
7 = left side extra static;
8 = right side extra static;
9 = both sides extra static;
10 = other issues;
11 = unbalanced channels.
</p>
<p><code>TOY</code>: time of year intervals used for stratified random
selection of dates. 8 intervals divided into 3 major units
(early, mid, and late breeding season; <code>YDAY</code> 140 and 180 were used
as threshold between the major units).
</p>
<p><code>TOD</code>: time of day, midnight (<code>HOUR</code> = 0) or
morning (<code>HOUR</code> &gt; 0).
</p>
<p>Variables in <code>birdrec$taxa</code> are the following:
<code>Species</code>, <code>CommonName</code>, <code>ScientificName</code>,
<code>Family</code>, <code>Order</code>, <code>Class</code>,
and <code>MigratoryBehaviour</code>.
</p>
<p>Methodology and metadata is described in ABMI (2016), and Lankau et al. (2015).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(birdrec)
str(birdrec)

aggregate(rowSums(birdrec$xtab),
    list(TOY=birdrec$samp$TOY, TOD=birdrec$samp$TOD), mean)
boxplot(rowSums(birdrec$xtab) ~ TOD + TOY, birdrec$samp,
    col=c("gold", "tomato"), ylab="# detections")

## Not run: 
y &lt;- ifelse(birdrec$xtab &gt; 0, 1, 0)
g &lt;- paste0(gsub("[[:digit:]]", "", as.character(birdrec$samp$TOY)),
    substr(as.character(birdrec$samp$TOD), 1, 4))
g &lt;- factor(g, levels=c("EarlyMorn", "MidMorn", "LateMorn",
    "EarlyMidn", "MidMidn", "LateMidn"))
## binary response model
oc &lt;- opticut(y ~ 1, strata=g, dist="binomial")
## multi-level response model
mc &lt;- multicut(y ~ 1, strata=g, dist="binomial")

## testing equality of labels
splito &lt;- as.character(summary(oc)$summary$split)
splitm &lt;- as.character(summary(mc)$summary$split)
table(splito == splitm)
## seeing how much those differ
bpo &lt;- summary(oc)$bestpart
bpm &lt;- summary(mc)$bestpart
rs &lt;- rowSums(abs(bpo-bpm))
table(rs)
10 * bpo[rs &gt; 0,] + bpm[rs &gt; 0,]
