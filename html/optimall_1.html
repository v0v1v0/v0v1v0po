<h2>Adaptive Multi-Wave Sampling</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Determines the adaptive optimum sampling allocation for a new sampling
wave based on results from previous waves. Using Neyman or
Wright (2014) allocation, <code>allocate_wave</code> calculates the
optimum allocation for the <em>total</em> number of samples
across waves, determines how many were allocated to each strata
in previous waves, and allocates the remaining samples to make
up the difference.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">allocate_wave(
  data,
  strata,
  y,
  already_sampled,
  nsample,
  allocation_method = c("WrightII", "WrightI", "Neyman"),
  method = c("iterative", "simple"),
  detailed = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame or matrix with one row for each
sampling unit, one column specifying each unit's stratum,
one column holding the value of the continuous variable for
which the variance should be minimized, and one column
containing a binary indicator, <code>already_sampled</code>,
specifying whether each unit has already been sampled.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>strata</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string or vector of character strings
specifying the name of columns that indicate the stratum that
each unit belongs to.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string specifying the name of the
continuous variable for which the variance should be minimized.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>already_sampled</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string specifying the name of a
column that contains a binary (<code>Y</code>/<code>N</code> or <code>1</code>
/<code>0</code>) indicator specifying whether each unit has already
been sampled in a previous wave.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nsample</code></td>
<td>
<p>The desired sample size of the next wave.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>allocation_method</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string specifying the method of
optimum sample allocation to use. For details see
<code>optimum_allocation()</code>. Defaults to <code>WrightII</code> which is more exact
than <code>Neyman</code> but may run slower.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string specifying the method to be
used if at least one group was oversampled. Must be one of:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>"iterative"</code>, the default, will require a longer
runtime but may be a more precise method of handling oversampled
strata. If there are multiple oversampled strata, this method
closes strata and re-calculates optimum allocation one by one.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"simple"</code> closes all oversampled together and
re-calculates optimum allocation on the rest of the strata only
once. In certain cases where many strata have been oversampled
in prior waves, it is possible that this method will output a
negative value in n_to_sample. When this occurs, the function
will print a warning, and it is recommended that the user
re-runs the allocation with the 'iterative' method.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>detailed</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical value indicating whether the output
dataframe should include details about each stratum including
the true optimum allocation without the constraint of
previous waves of sampling
and stratum standard deviations. Defaults to FALSE, unless called within
<code>apply_multiwave()</code>.
These details are all available from
<code>optimum_allocation()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If the optimum sample size in a stratum is smaller than the
amount it was allocated in previous waves, that strata has been
<em>oversampled</em>. When oversampling occurs,
<code>allocate_wave</code> "closes" the oversampled strata and
re-allocates the remaining samples optimally among the open
strata. Under these circumstances, the total sampling
allocation is no longer optimal, but <code>optimall</code> will
output the <em>most</em> optimal allocation possible for the next wave.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a dataframe with one row for each stratum and
columns specifying the stratum name ("strata"), population stratum size
(<code>"npop"</code>), cumulative sample in that strata
(<code>"nsample_actual"</code>), prior number sampled in that
strata (<code>"nsample_prior"</code>), and the optimally allocated
number of units in each strata for the next wave (<code>"n_to_sample"</code>).
