<h2>An <code>R6Class</code> object representing an ensemble of aircraft 
state vectors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>R6Class</code> object representing an ensemble of aircraft state vectors. 
Contains a list of objects of class <code>openSkiesStateVector</code>. The
ensemble can either represent a time series of state vectors of a single 
aircraft, or represent state vectors corresponding to multiple different
aircrafts. For details on the information stored in each state vector, see
the documentation for the <code>openSkiesStateVector</code> class. New instances can be manually 
created by providing a list of <code>openSkiesStateVector</code> objects.
Alternatively, <code>getSingleTimeStateVectors</code> and <code>getAircraftStateVectorsSeries</code> 
will return an <code>openSkiesStateVectorSet</code> object if multiple state
vectors matching the query conditions are found.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">openSkiesStateVectorSet
</code></pre>


<h3>Fields</h3>


<dl>
<dt><code>state_vectors</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>List of <code>openSkiesStateVector</code> objects
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>time_series</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Logical indicating if the <code>openSkiesStateVectorSet</code>
object represents a time series of state vectors of a single aircraft.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Methods</h3>


<dl>
<dt>
<code>add_state_vector(state_vector)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method adds a new state vector to the openSkiesAircraft object, which
will be set as the new <code>last_state_vector</code> and will be added to
<code>state_vector_history</code>. <code>state_vector</code> should be an
<code>openSkiesStateVector</code> object
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>get_values(fields, removeNAs=FALSE, unwrapAngles=FALSE)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method retrieves all the values for the specified fields in the 
ensemble of <code>openSkiesStateVector</code> objects. One or several
field names can be provided through the <code>fields</code> argument. The values
will be returned as a vector if a single field was provided, or as a data
frame if multiple fields were provided. Field names should match those of
the fields of <code>openSkiesStateVector</code> objects. If <code>removeNAs=TRUE</code>,
NA values will be omitted from the output (if multiple fields were provided,
only state vectors for which all of the fields were NA will be omitted).
If <code>unwrapAngles=TRUE</code> and values for the <code>true_track</code> field
were requested, the values will be unwrapped to be a smooth succession of
values without sudden discontinuities when crossing from 360ยบ to 0ยบ
(this will likely make multiple values become higher than 360).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>get_uniform_interpolation(n, fields, method="fmm")</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method obtains a data frame with an interpolation of the specified fields along the
route represented by the state vector set across n evenly distributed points. <code>fields</code>
should be a character vector with the name of the fields that will be interpolated.
Only numeric fields are accepted. <code>method</code> represents the interpolation method.
"linear" will result in linear interpolation, while "fmm", "periodic", or "natural" will result
in different types of spline interpolation.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>get_time_points_interpolation(fields, time_field, timestamps, method="fmm")</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method obtains a data frame with an interpolation of the specified fields along the
route represented by the state vector set across the specified timestamps. <code>fields</code>
should be a character vector with the name of the fields that will be interpolated.
Only numeric fields are accepted. <code>method</code> represents the interpolation method.
"linear" will result in linear interpolation, while "fmm", "periodic", or "natural" will result
in different types of spline interpolation. <code>time_field</code> indicates the
name of the field of the openSkiesStateVectorSet object from which the 
timestamps of the original state vectors will be retrieved. Possible values
are <code>c("requested_time", "last_position_update_time", "last_any_update_time")</code>.
The time points at which the interpolations should be calculated should be
provided as a vector through the <code>timestamps</code> argument.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>sort_by_field(field, decreasing=FALSE)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method sorts the state vectors of the openSkiesStateVectorSet object
by the values of the field provided through <code>field</code>. By default,
<code>decreasing=FALSE</code> and the state vectors will be sorted by increasing 
order of <code>field</code>. If <code>decreasing=TRUE</code>, decreasing order will be
used.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>split_into_flights(timeOnLandThreshold=300, timeDiffThreshold=1800)</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method automatically detects different flights contained in the
openSkiesStateVectorSet object and returns a list of objects of class
<code>openSkiesFlight</code>. Separate flights are detected based on two
conditions: either the aircraft staying on ground for a given amount of
time, or the aircraft not sending any status update for a given period. The
thresholds are controlled, respectively, through the <code>timeOnLandThreshold</code>
and <code>timeDiffThreshold</code> arguments. In both cases, the value should be
provided in seconds.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>remove_redundants(updateType="position")</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This method removes redundant state vectors, i.e., those that do not
contain updated information with respect to older state vectors. What is
considered as a redundant state vector is defined by the <code>updateType</code> 
argument. If <code>updateType="position"</code>, which is also the default
behavior, state vectors for which there was no update of positional
information will be considered as redundant (even if there might have been
an update of other information). If <code>updateType="any"</code>, only state
vectors for which no information was updated (positional or any other) will
be considered as redundant. It should be noted that applying this method
will also sort the state vectors from older to more recent. The method
is intended to be applied to time series, and therefore a warning will be
given if it is applied on an <code>openSkiesStateVectorSet</code> with
field <code>time_series=FALSE</code>.
