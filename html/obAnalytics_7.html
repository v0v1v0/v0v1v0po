<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The purpose of this table is to keep account of the lifecycle of all orders
in both sides of the limit order book. The lifecycle of an individual limit
order follows a sequence of events:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>created</dt>
<dd>
<p>The order is created with a specified amount of volume and
a limit price.</p>
</dd>
<dt>changed</dt>
<dd>
<p>The order has been partially filled. On each modification, 
the remaining volume will decrease.</p>
</dd>
<dt>deleted</dt>
<dd>
<p>The order may be deleted at the request of the trader or, in
the event that the order has been completely filled, deleted by the exchange.
An order deleted by the exchange as a result of being filled will have 0
remaining volume at time of deletion.</p>
