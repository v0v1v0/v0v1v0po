<strong>ordr</strong> package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a <strong><a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a></strong> extension
for handling, manipulating, and visualizing ordination models with
consistent conventions and in a tidy workflow.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package is designed to integrate ordination analysis and biplot
visualization into a <strong>tidyverse</strong> workflow. It is inspired in particular by
the extensions <strong>ggbiplot</strong> and <strong>tidygraph</strong>.
</p>
<p>The package consists in several modules:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> the 'tbl_ord' class, a wrapper for various ordination object classes
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> extracting augmentation for the factors of an ordination
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> using dplyr-verbs to add annotation to the factors
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> adjusting the conference of inertia between the factors
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> methods of the above generics for several widely-used object classes
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> convenient formatting of ordination objects
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ggbiplot()</code>, a <strong>ggplot2</strong> extension for rendering biplots
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> additional stats and geoms for biplots
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ordinations and biplots</h3>

<p><em>Ordination</em> encompasses a variety of techniques for data compression,
dimension reduction, feature extraction, and visualization. Well-known
ordination techniques are predominantly unsupervised and include principal
components analysis, multidimensional scaling, and correspondence analyis
(Podani, 2000, Chapter 7; Palmer, n.d.). These methods are theoretically
grounded in geometric data analysis (Le Roux &amp; Rouanet, 2004) and powered by
the matrix factorizations described below. A variety of other techniques may
also be viewed, or treated using the same tools, as ordination, including
linear regression, linear discriminant analysis, k-means clustering, and
non-negative matrix factorization.
</p>
<p><em>Biplots</em> are two-layered scatterplots widely used to visualize unsupervised
SVD-based ordinations. Gabriel (1971) introduced biplots to represent the
scores and loadings of PCA on a single set of axes. They have also been used
to visualize generalized linear regression and linear discriminant analysis
(Greenacre, 2010) and can adapted to any 2-factor matrix decomposition.
</p>


<h3>Singular value decomposition</h3>

<p>The most popular ordination techniques use singular value decomposition (SVD)
to factor a data matrix <code class="reqn">X</code> into a product <code class="reqn">X=UDV'</code> of two orthogonal
(rotation) matrices <code class="reqn">U</code> and <code class="reqn">V</code> and a diagonal (scaling) matrix
<code class="reqn">D</code>, with <code class="reqn">V'</code> the transpose of <code class="reqn">V</code>. In most cases, the data
matrix <code class="reqn">X</code> is transformed from an original data matrix, e.g. by
centering, scaling, double-centering, or log-transforming. The SVD introduces
a set of shared orthogonal coordinates in which <code class="reqn">U</code> encodes the rows of
<code class="reqn">X</code> and <code class="reqn">V</code> encodes the columns of <code class="reqn">X</code>. The singular values in
<code class="reqn">D</code> are the variances of <code class="reqn">X</code> along each of these coordinates, and
they proceed in decreasing order, so that the first <code class="reqn">r</code> (for "rank")
columns of <code class="reqn">U</code> and of <code class="reqn">V</code> produce a geometrically optimized
approximation to <code class="reqn">X</code>.
</p>
<p>Biplots of SVD-based ordinations usually plot the rows and columns of <code class="reqn">X</code>
on these <code class="reqn">r</code> coordinate axes. For an SVD-based biplot to be truly
geometric, the total variance contained in <code class="reqn">D</code> must be conferred onto
<code class="reqn">U</code> or <code class="reqn">V</code>, or distributed over both (Orlov, 2015). When <code class="reqn">D</code> is
conferred onto <code class="reqn">U</code>, the rows of <code class="reqn">X</code> are represented by the rows of
<code class="reqn">UD</code>, and their distances in the biplot approximate their distances in
the original column space of <code class="reqn">X</code>. Meanwhile, the columns of <code class="reqn">X</code> are
represented by the rows of <code class="reqn">V</code>. These are unit vectors in the full space
of shared coordinates, so their squared lengths in the biplot indicate the
proportion of their variance captured by the biplot axes and their cosines
with each other approximate the correlations between the columns. Finally,
the projection of a row's coordinates (point) onto a column's coordinates
(vector) approximates the corresponding entry of <code class="reqn">X</code>.
