<h2>Ordinal forests</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Constructs prediction rules using the ordinal forest (OF) method presented in Hornung (2020). <br>
The following tasks can be performed using OF: 1) Predicting the values of an ordinal target variable for new observations based on covariate values (see <code>predict.ordfor</code>);
2) Ranking the importances of the covariates with respect to predicting the values of the ordinal target variable. <br>
The default values for the hyperparameters <code>nsets</code>, <code>ntreeperdiv</code>, <code>ntreefinal</code>, <code>npermtrial</code>, and <code>nbest</code>
were found to be in a reasonable range in Hornung (2020) and it should not be necessary to alter these values in most situations. <br>
For details on OFs see the 'Details' section below. <br>
NOTE: Starting with package version 2.4, it is also possible to obtain class probability 
predictions in addition to the class point predictions and variable importance values
based on the class probabilities through using the (negative) ranked probability score (Epstein, 1969)
as performance function (<code>perffunction="probability"</code>). Using the ranked probability score in the variable importance can be expected to deliver more stable variable rankings, because the ranked probability score accounts for the ordinal scale of the dependent variable.  In situations in which there is no need for predicting class probabilities, but simply
class predictions are sufficient, other performance functions may be more suitable. See the subsection "Performance functions" in the "Details" section below for further details.

<h3>Details</h3>



<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>The ordinal forest (OF) method allows ordinal regression with high-dimensional and low-dimensional 
data. After having constructed an OF prediction rule using a training dataset, it can be used to predict the values of the ordinal target variable for new observations.
Moreover, by means of the (permutation-based) variable importance measure of OF, it is also 
possible to rank the covariates with respect to their importance in the prediction of the values
of the ordinal target variable. <br>
OF is presented in Hornung (2020). See the latter publication for details on the method. In the
following, a brief, practice-orientated introduction to OF is provided.
</p>



<h4>Methods</h4>

<p>The concept of OF is based on the following assumption: There exists a (possibly latent) refined continuous 
variable y* underlying the observed ordinal target variable y (y in {1,...,J}, J number of classes), where y* determines the
values of y. The functional relationship between y* and y takes the form of a monotonically increasing
step function. Depending on which of J intervals ]c_1,<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠ ⁠</code>c_2], <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠ ⁠</code>]c_2,<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠ ⁠</code>c_3], <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠ ⁠</code> ..., <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠ ⁠</code> ]c_J,<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠ ⁠</code>c_{J+1}[
contains the value of y*, the ordinal target variable y takes a different value.
</p>
<p>In situations in which the values of the continuous target variable y* are known, they can be used in regression techniques for continuous response variables.
The OF method is, however, concerned with settings in which only the values of the classes of the ordinal target variable are given.
The main idea of OF is to optimize score values s_1,...,s_J to be used in place of the class values 1,...,J of the ordinal target variable
in standard regression forests by maximizing the out-of-bag (OOB) prediction performance measured by a performance function g (see section 
"Performance functions").
</p>
<p>The approximation of the optimal score set consists of two steps:<br>
1) Construct a large number of regression forests (b in 1,...,<code>nsets</code>) featuring limited numbers 
of trees, where each of these uses as the values of the target variable a randomly generated score set 
s_{b,1},...,s_{b,J}. For each forest constructed, calculate the value of the performance function g 
using the OOB estimated predictions of the values of the ordinal target variable and the corresponding 
true values.<br>
2) Calculate the approximated optimal score set s_1,...,s_J as a summary over the <code>nbest</code> best score sets generated in 1),
that is, those <code>nbest</code> score sets that were associated with the highest values of the performance function g.
</p>
<p>After calculating the optimized score set, a larger regression forest is constructed using this optimized score set
s_1,...,s_J for the class values 1,...,J of the target variable. This regression forest is the OF prediction rule.
</p>
<p>Except in the case of using the (negative) ranked probabilty score as performance function, prediction is performed by majority voting of the predictions of the individual trees in the OF.
If the (negative) ranked probabilty score is used as performance function, both class predictions and predicted class probabilities are provided: The class probabilities
are obtained by averaging over the class probabilities predicted by the individual trees and the class predictions are obtained as the classes with maximum class probabilites.
</p>
<p>OF features a permutation variable importance measure that, if <code>importance</code> is set to <code>"rps"</code> (default), uses the ranked probability
score as error measure and the misclassification error else (<code>importance="accuracy"</code>).
</p>



<h4>Hyperparameters</h4>

<p>There are several hyperparameters, which do, however, not have to be optimized by the user in general, because the default values
used for these hyperparameters were seen to be in a reasonable range and the results seem to be quite robust with respect to the 
choices of the hyperparameter values.
</p>
<p>These hyperparameters are described in the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>nsets</code> <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠   ⁠</code> Default value: 1000. The default value of the number of considered score sets in the approximation of the optimal score set 
is quite large. A large number of considered score sets is necessary to attain a high chance that some of the score sets are close enough to the optimal score set,
that is, the score set that leads to the optimal OOB prediction performance with respect to the considered performance function (provided with the argument <code>perffunction</code>).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ntreeperdiv</code> <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠   ⁠</code> Default value: 100. A very small number of trees considered per tried
score set might lead to a too strong variability in the assessments of the performances achieved for the individual score sets. For ultra-high dimensional
covariate data it might be necessary to choose a higher value for <code>ntreeperdiv</code> than the default value 100.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ntreefinal</code> <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠   ⁠</code> Default value: 5000. The number of trees <code>ntreefinal</code>
plays the same role as in conventional regression forests.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>npermtrial</code> <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠   ⁠</code> Default value: 500. As stated above it is necessary to consider a large number of tried score sets <code>nsets</code> in the
optimization in order to increase the chance that the best of the considered score sets are close to the optimal score set.
To further increase this chance, it is in addition necessary that the collection of score sets tried is heterogeneous enough across 
the iterations. OF uses a particular algorithm for sampling the score sets tried that leads to a strongly heterogeneous collection of sets.
This algorithm features the hyperparameter <code>npermtrial</code>, where it has been seen in Hornung (2020) that the results are quite 
robust with respect to the choice of the value of this parameter.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>nbest</code> <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠   ⁠</code> Default value: 10. In the case of a relatively small value of <code>nsets</code>, it is important that the 
number <code>nbest</code> of best score sets used to calculate the optimized score set is not strongly misspecified. A too large value of <code>nbest</code> 
leads to including suboptimal score sets into the calculation of the optimized score set that are too distinct from the optimal score set.
Conversely, a too small value of <code>nbest</code> leads to a high variance of the optimized score set. The combination <code>nsets=1000</code> and <code>nbest=10</code>
should lead to a good trade-off between the heterogeneity of the considered score sets and the variance in the estimation.
In Hornung (2020) this combination delivered good results and it was seen that using a very large value of <code>nbest</code> can lead to worse results.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Performance functions</h4>

<p>As noted above, the different score sets tried during the estimation of the optimal score set are assessed with respect to their OOB prediction performance.
The choice of the specific performance function used in these assessments determines the specific kind of performance the ordinal forest should feature:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>perffunction="equal"</code> <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠   ⁠</code> This choice should be made if it is of interest to classify observations from each class with the same accuracy independent of the class sizes. 
Youden's J statistic is calculated with respect to each class ("observation/prediction in class j" vs. "observation/prediction NOT in class j" (j=1,...,J))
and the simple average of the J results taken.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>perffunction="probability"</code> <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠   ⁠</code> This choice should be made if it is of interest to predict class probabilties for the observations.
The ranked probability score is calculated between the predicted probabilities for the J classes and the observed class values. Because smaller values
of the ranked probability score correspond to a better prediction, the negative ranked probability score is considered as performance functions.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>perffunction="proportional"</code> <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠   ⁠</code> This choice should be made if the main goal is to classify
correctly as many observations as possible. The latter is associated with a preference for larger classes at the 
expense of a lower classification accuracy with respect to smaller classes.
Youden's J statistic is calculated with respect to each class and subsequently a weighted average of these values is taken - with weights 
proportional to the number of observations representing the respective classes in the training data.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>perffunction="oneclass"</code> <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠   ⁠</code> This choice should be made if it is merely relevant that observations 
in class <code>categ</code> can be distinguished as reliably as possible from observations not in class <code>categ</code>.
Class <code>categ</code> must be passed to <code>ordfor</code> via the argument <code>categ</code>.
Youden's J statistic is calculated with respect to class <code>categ</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>perffunction="custom"</code> <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠   ⁠</code> This choice should be made if there is a particular ranking of the classes with respect to their importance. 
Youden's J statistic is calculated with respect to each class. Subsequently, a weighted average
with user-specified weights (provided via the argument <code>classweights</code>) is taken. In this way, classes with 
higher weights are prioritized by the OF algorithm over classes with smaller weights.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
