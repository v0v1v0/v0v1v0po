<h2>Experimental: Create a new MILP Model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create an an empty mixed-integer linear programming model that is
about 1000 times faster than 'MIPModel'.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">MILPModel()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Please only use it if you can deal with potential API changes in the future.
When you use 'MILPModel' make sure to always model your problem with
'MIPModel' as well, just to make sure you get the same results.
</p>
<p>It is also always a good idea to test your model with very small input sizes
and examine the coefficients and rows of the constraint matrix.
