<h2>Generation of a Burst Signal with Linear Rise and Decline</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function takes in numeric arguments for a customizable, burst shape with linear rise and decline. Each oscillation cycle is separated into four phases: the growth phase, in which the oscillator rises from the baseline to the peak concentration, a first drop phase, in which the oscillator declines from the peak to the secondary peak concentration, a second drop phase, in which the oscillator declines from the secondary peak to the baseline concentration and an inactive phase, in which the oscillator stays at baseline concentration. A discretized time course is returned.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">LinBurst(baseline, peak, period, duty_cycle, sec_duty_cycle, sec_peak, trend,
  peak_pos, duration, resolution)
