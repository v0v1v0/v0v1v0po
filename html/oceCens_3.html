<h2>oceCens: A package for ordered composite endpoints with censoring.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An ordered composite endpoint combines several time-to-event endpoints
into one score. The package compares two groups with two parameters, the
win ratio, P[Y1&gt;Y0]/P[Y0&gt;Y1], and the Mann-Whitney parameter,
P[Y1&gt;Y0]+(1/2)P[Y1=Y0], where Y1 and Y0 are the oce scores in the two groups.
The main function is <code>oceTest</code>, which calls many of the other
functions and has several different methods for estimation.
Statistical details are in Follmann, et al 2020.
