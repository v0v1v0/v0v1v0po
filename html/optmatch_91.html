<h2>Optimal 1:1 and 1:k matching</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a treatment group, a larger control reservoir, and a method for creating
discrepancies between each treatment and control unit (or optionally an
already created such discrepancy matrix), finds a pairing of treatment units
to controls that minimizes the sum of discrepancies.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pairmatch(x, controls = 1, data = NULL, remove.unmatchables = FALSE, ...)

pair(x, controls = 1, data = NULL, remove.unmatchables = FALSE, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Any valid input to <code>match_on</code>. If <code>x</code> is a numeric vector,
there must also be passed a vector <code>z</code> indicating grouping. Both vectors
must be named.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, a precomputed distance may be entered.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>controls</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of controls to be matched to each treatment</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional data set.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>remove.unmatchables</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should treatment group members for which there are
no eligible controls be removed prior to matching?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Additional arguments to pass to <code>match_on</code>
(e.g. <code>within</code>)) or to <code>fullmatch</code> (e.g. <code>tol</code>).
It is an error to pass <code>min.controls</code>,
<code>max.controls</code>, <code>mean.controls</code> or <code>omit.fraction</code> as
<code>pairmatch</code> must set these values.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is a wrapper to <code>fullmatch</code>; see its documentation for more
information, especially on additional arguments to pass, additional discussion
of valid input for parameter <code>x</code>, and feasibility recovery.
</p>
<p>If <code>remove.unmatchables</code> is <code>FALSE</code>, then if there are unmatchable
treated units then the matching as a whole will fail and no units will be
matched.  If <code>TRUE</code>, then this unit will be removed and the function will
attempt to match each of the other treatment units.  As of version 0.9-8,
if there are fewer matchable treated units than matchable controls then
<code>pairmatch</code> will attempt to place each into a matched pair each of the
matchable controls and a strict subset of the matchable treated units.
(Previously matching would have failed for subclasses of this structure.)
</p>
<p>Matching can still fail,
even with <code>remove.unmatchables</code> set to <code>TRUE</code>,
if there is too much competition for certain controls; if you
find yourself in that situation you should consider full matching, which
necessarily finds a match for everyone with an eligible match somewhere.
</p>
<p>The units of the <code>optmatch</code> object returned correspond to members of the
treatment and control groups in reference to which the matching problem was
posed, and are named accordingly; the names are taken from the row and column
names of <code>distance</code> (with possible additions from the optional
<code>data</code> argument).  Each element of the vector is the concatenation of:
(i) a character abbreviation of <code>subclass.indices</code>, if that argument was
given, or the string '<code>m</code>' if it was not; (ii) the string <code>.</code>; and
(iii) a non-negative integer. Unmatched units have <code>NA</code> entries.
Secondarily, <code>fullmatch</code> returns various data about the matching process
and its result, stored as attributes of the named vector which is its primary
output.  In particular, the <code>exceedances</code> attribute gives upper bounds,
not necessarily sharp, for the amount by which the sum of distances between
matched units in the result of <code>fullmatch</code> exceeds the least possible sum
of distances between matched units in a feasible solution to the matching
problem given to <code>fullmatch</code>.  (Such a bound is also printed by
<code>print.optmatch</code> and by <code>summary.optmatch</code>.)
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>optmatch</code> object (<code>factor</code>) indicating matched groups.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(nuclearplants)

### Pair matching on a Mahalanobis distance
( pm1 &lt;- pairmatch(pr ~ t1 + t2, data = nuclearplants) )
summary(pm1)

### Pair matching within a propensity score caliper.
ppty &lt;- glm(pr ~ . - (pr + cost), family = binomial(), data = nuclearplants)
### For more complicated models, create a distance matrix and pass it to fullmatch.
mhd &lt;- match_on(pr ~ t1 + t2, data = nuclearplants) + caliper(match_on(ppty), 2)
( pm2 &lt;- pairmatch(mhd, data = nuclearplants) )
summary(pm2)

### Propensity balance assessment. Requires RItools package.
if(require(RItools)) summary(pm2, ppty)

### 1:2 matched triples
( tm &lt;- pairmatch(pr ~ t1 + t2, controls = 2, data = nuclearplants) )
summary(tm)

### Creating a data frame with the matched sets attached.
### match_on(), caliper() and the like cooperate with pairmatch()
### to make sure observations are in the proper order:
all.equal(names(tm), row.names(nuclearplants))
### So our data frame including the matched sets is just
cbind(nuclearplants, matches=tm)

### In contrast, if your matching distance is an ordinary matrix
### (as earlier versions of optmatch required), you'll
### have to align it by observation name with your data set.
cbind(nuclearplants, matches = tm[row.names(nuclearplants)])


### Match in subgroups only. There are a few ways to specify this.
m1 &lt;- pairmatch(pr ~ t1 + t2, data=nuclearplants,
                within=exactMatch(pr ~ pt, data=nuclearplants))
m2 &lt;- pairmatch(pr ~ t1 + t2 + strata(pt), data=nuclearplants)
### Matching on propensity scores within matching in subgroups only:
m3 &lt;- pairmatch(glm(pr ~ t1 + t2, data=nuclearplants, family=binomial),
                data=nuclearplants,
                within=exactMatch(pr ~ pt, data=nuclearplants))
m4 &lt;- pairmatch(glm(pr ~ t1 + t2 + pt, data=nuclearplants,
                    family=binomial),
                data=nuclearplants,
                within=exactMatch(pr ~ pt, data=nuclearplants))
m5 &lt;- pairmatch(glm(pr ~ t1 + t2 + strata(pt), data=nuclearplants,
                    family=binomial), data=nuclearplants)
# Including `strata(foo)` inside a glm uses `foo` in the model as
# well, so here m4 and m5 are equivalent. m3 differs in that it does
# not include `pt` in the glm.
