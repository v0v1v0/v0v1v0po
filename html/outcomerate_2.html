<h2>outcomerate Formula Matrix (Internal Data)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>fmat</code> object is the internal dataset used by the <code>outcomerate</code> package.
It holds all definitions for the outcome rates. With the exception of location
rates, these are taken from the AAPOR Standard Definitions (2016).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data is a 3-dimensional binary array consisting of:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> outcome: codes I, P, R, NC, O, UH, UO, eUH, eUO, NE
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> rate: the shorthand name for the rate (e.g. RR1)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> side: numerator (NUM) and denominator (DEN)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these three dimensions, each outcome rate can be defined as a rational
number (i.e. a fraction) consisting of a summation of frequencies of
outcome codes (where the matrix entries are nonzero).
</p>
<p>The input parameters given by the user are I, P, R, NC, O, UH, UO and
the parameter 'e'. The parameter e is multiplied by UH, UO internally so as to
produce eUH, eUO.
</p>
<p>The reason for this implementation is:
</p>
<p>a) It conforms to a DRY (don't repeat yourself) philosophy by
holding all definitions in one place. These definitions can be used as upstream
inputs to functions/test suites requiring them.
</p>
<p>b) It makes it easier to use intermediate steps in the formula calculations.
For instance, it may be of use to a researchers to want to obtain the
numerator/denominators of calculations, instead of only the output.
</p>
<p>c) it makes it easy to compare the output
</p>
<p>d) It is easier to maintain
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fmat &lt;- outcomerate:::fmat

# Print the dimensions
dimnames(fmat)

# Say we want to know the defintion of Response Rate 2, RR2. We see
# below that the numerator (NUM) column is defined by the entries with a 1,
# or (I + P). Likewise, the denominator (DEN) is defined as
# (I + P + R + NC + O + UH + UO)
fmat[, "RR2", ]


# To use linear algebra, we define a zero-one numerator matrix 'N'
# and a zero-one denominator matrix 'D'. Our count of disposition codes
# is given here manually as 'x' (in the same order as N and D).
N = fmat[ , , 1]
D = fmat[ , , 2]
x &lt;- c(I = 5, P = 2, R = 1, NC = 7, O = 3,
      UH = 4, UO = 8,  NE = 1, eUH = 3, eUO = 6)

# Return all rates
(x %*% N) / (x %*% D)


# The same thing can be achieved with the apply family of functions
numden &lt;- apply(x * fmat, 2:3, sum)
numden[, 1] / numden[, 2]
