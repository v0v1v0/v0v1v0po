<h2>Tomoka Ohta's D Statistics</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implements Ohta's D statistics for a pair of loci. Statistics are returned in a vector in the following order:
Number of populations, D2it, D2is, D2st, D'2st, D'2is.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dstat(index, data_set, tot_maf = 0.1, pop_maf = 0.05)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>index</code></td>
<td>
<p>A two-element vector of column names or numbers for which
Ohta's D Statistics will be computed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data_set</code></td>
<td>
<p>Matrix containing genotype data with individuals as rows and
loci as columns. Genotypes should be coded as 0 (homozygous), 1 (heterozygous),
or 2 (homozygous). Rownames must be subpopulation names and column names
should be marker names.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tot_maf</code></td>
<td>
<p>Minimum minor allele frequency across the total population
for a marker to be included in the analysis.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pop_maf</code></td>
<td>
<p>Minimum minor allele frequency across a subpopulation for
that subpopulation to be included in analysis.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When the loci being evaluated fail to pass the filtering thresholds determined by
tot_maf and pop_maf, NAs are returned.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>nPops Number of subpopulations used for computation, after filtering.
</p>
<p>D2it A measure of the correlation of alleles at two loci on the same
gametes in a subpopulation relative to their expectation according to allele
frequencies in the total population.
</p>
<p>D2is Expected variance of LD for subpopulations.
</p>
<p>D2st Expected correlation of alleles in a subpopulation relative to their
expected correlation in the total population.
</p>
<p>Dp2st Variance of LD for the total population computed over alleles only.
</p>
<p>Dp2is Correlation of alleles at two loci on the same gamete in subpopulations
relative to their expected correlation in the total population.
