<h2>Simulate mean total lifetime</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is used to simulate mean total lifetime for a given initial state
according to the estimated transition probabilities.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sim.MTL(obj, state = NULL, nsim = 1000, L = 120)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>obj</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object returned by <code>optim.fit</code>, which contains the transition probabilities
and other information used to simulate mean total lifetime.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>state</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector indicating from which state the mean total lifetime is simulated.
Default is NULL, where no mean total life for a specific state is output. If obj is returned by optim.fit with
treatment=NULL, there is no need to set this argument.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nsim</code></td>
<td>
<p>The times of simulation. The default is 1000.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>L</code></td>
<td>
<p>The prespecified threshold for blocking the increase of residual lifetime. The default is 120.
See Details.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This part describes the algorithm used to simulate mean total lifetime in detail.
For an initial state, we first extract the transition probability data frame for this state,
and cumulate probabilities in row direction. In the transformed data frame, the first column
of which impels the time points where transition probabilities are measured, and the last column
is accumulated to be 1, indicating the addition of the chance to depart from a state and the
chance to remain at the state equals 1. Then, we generate a random
value from uniform distribution <code>Unif(0,1)</code> to determine the next state by comparing
this value to cumulative probabilities. The state, whose cumulative transition probability
from initial state firstly surpasses the uniform value, is defined as the next state.
The time interval, from the initiation of the study to where the transition take place,
is defined as the interim residual life. These two variables (next state and interim residual life)
are recorded for late use. Subsequently, we regard the next state as the
initial state, and repeat this searching process until the absorbing state is
reached or the interim residual lifetime surpasses the prespecified threshold (<code>L</code>).
Finally, the mean total life is either the last interim residual lifetime from the initiation
of study to the occurrence of absorbing state, or the prespecified threshold (<code>L</code>) if the
absorbing has not reached yet.
</p>
<p>If a state is given in this function, we set this state as initial state and perform the algorithm
mentioned above for <code>nsim</code> times, and average the output to obtain mean total lifetime.
</p>
<p>According to different type of input object, this function return different results.
If the object comes from optim.fit with <code>treatment=NULL</code>, this function is used to simulate mean
total lifetime for a given state. If the object comes from optim.fit with <code>treatment</code> not
equals <code>NULL</code>, this function is used to compare mean total lifetimes of subjects who receive the new treatment to
those who do not receive the new treatment.
