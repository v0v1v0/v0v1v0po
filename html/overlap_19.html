Simulated data for diel activity patterns
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>tigerObs and pigObs are simulated data sets with times of observation. tigerTrue and pigTrue are densities from which the simulated observations were drawn.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(simulatedData)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The data set consists of four vectors:
</p>
<p>tigerObs is a vector of 100 observations of a crepuscular species in radians.
</p>
<p>pigObs is a vector of 80 observations of a diurnal species in radians.
</p>
<p>tigerTrue and pigTrue are vectors of densities at 128 times equidistant between 0 and <code class="reqn">2\pi</code> inclusive.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The figures below show the true densities (solid line), the simulated data (rug at the foot of the plot) and a kernel density fitted to the simulated data (dotted line).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(simulatedData)

xx &lt;- seq(0, 2*pi, length=128)
plot(xx, tigerTrue, type='l') # True density from which sample was drawn
rug(tigerObs)
