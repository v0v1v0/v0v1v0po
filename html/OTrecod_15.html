<td><code>datab</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data.frame made up of two overlayed databases with at least four columns sorted in a random order. One column must be a column dedicated to the identification of the two databases ranked in ascending order
(For example: 1 for the top database and 2 for the database from below, or more logically here A and B  ...But not B and A!). One column (<code class="reqn">Y</code> here but other names are allowed)
must correspond to the target variable related to the information of interest to merge with its specific encoding in the database A (corresponding encoding should be missing in the database B). In the same way,
one column (<code class="reqn">Z</code> here) corresponds to the second target variable with its specific encoding in the database B (corresponding encoding should be missing in the database A).
Finally, the input database must have at least one shared covariate with same encoding in A and B. Please notice that, if your data.frame has only one shared covariate (four columns) with missing values (because no imputation is desired)
then a warning will appear and the algorithm will only run with complete cases.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A. THE RECODING PROBLEM IN DATA FUSION
</p>
<p>Assuming that <code class="reqn">Y</code> and <code class="reqn">Z</code> are two target variables which refered to the same target population in two separate databases A and B respectively (no overlapping rows),
so that <code class="reqn">Y</code> and <code class="reqn">Z</code> are never jointly observed. Assuming also that A and B share a subset of common covariates <code class="reqn">X</code> of any types (same encodings in A and B)
completed or not. Merging these two databases often requires to solve a recoding problem by creating an unique database where
the missing information of <code class="reqn">Y</code> and <code class="reqn">Z</code> is fully completed.
</p>
<p>B. INFORMATIONS ABOUT THE ALGORITHM
</p>
<p>The algorithm integrated in the function <code>OT_outcome</code> provides a solution to the recoding problem previously described by proposing an
application of optimal transportation which aims is to search for a bijective mapping between the distributions of of <code class="reqn">Y</code> in A and <code class="reqn">Z</code> in B.
Mathematically, the principle of the algorithm is based on the resolution of an optimization problem which provides an optimal solution <code class="reqn">\gamma</code> (as called in the related articles)
that transfers the distribution of <code class="reqn">Y</code> in A to the distribution of <code class="reqn">Z</code> in B (or conversely, according to the sense of the transport)and can be so interpreted as an estimator of the joint distribution
<code class="reqn">(Y,Z)</code> in A (or B respetively). According to this result, a second step of the algorithm provides individual predictions of <code class="reqn">Y</code> in B (resp. of <code class="reqn">Z</code> in A, or both, depending on the choice
specified by user in the argument <code>which.DB</code>). Two possible approaches are available depending on the argument <code>indiv.method</code>:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> When <code>indiv.method = "sequential"</code>, a nearest neighbor procedure is applied. This corresponds to the use of the function <code>indiv_grp_closest</code>
implemented in the function <code>OT_outcome</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> When <code>indiv.method = "optimal"</code>, a linear optimization problem is solved to determine the individual predictions that minimize the sum of the individual distances
in A (resp. in B) with the modalities of <code class="reqn">Z</code> in B (resp. <code class="reqn">Y</code> in A). This approach is applied via the function <code>indiv_grp_optimal</code> implemented in the function <code>OT_outcome</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This algorithm supposes the respect of the two following assumptions:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">Y</code> must follow the same distribution in A and B. In the same way, <code class="reqn">Z</code> follows the same distribution in the two databases.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The conditional distribution <code class="reqn">(Y|X)</code> must be identical in A and B. Respectively, <code class="reqn">(Z|X)</code> is supposed identical in A and B.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Because the first assumption can be too strong in some situations, a relaxation of the constraints of marginal distribution is possible using the argument <code>maxrelax</code>.
When <code>indiv.method = "sequential"</code> and <code>maxrelax = 0</code>, the algorithm called <code>OUTCOME</code> (see (1) and (2))
is applied. In all other situations, the algorithm applied corresponds to an algorithm called <code>R_OUTCOME</code> (see (2)).
A posteriori estimates of conditional probabilities <code class="reqn">P[Y|X,Z]</code> and <code class="reqn">P[Z|X,Y]</code> are available for each profile of covariates (see the output objects <code>estimatorYB</code> and <code>estimatorZA</code>).
Estimates of <code class="reqn">\gamma</code> are also available according to the desired direction of the transport (from A to B and/or conversely. See <code class="reqn">\gamma_A</code> and <code class="reqn">\gamma_B</code>).
</p>
<p>C. EXPECTED STRUCTURE FOR THE INPUT DATABASE
</p>
<p>The input database is a data.frame that must be saved in a specific form by users:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Two overlayed databases containing a common column of database identifiers (A and B, 1 or 2, by examples, encoded in numeric or factor form)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A column corresponding to the target variable with its specific encoding in A (For example a factor <code class="reqn">Y</code> encoded in <code class="reqn">n_Y</code> levels, ordered or not, with NAs in the corresponding rows of B)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A column corresponding to the second target outcome with its specific endoded in B (For example a factor <code class="reqn">Z</code> in <code class="reqn">n_Z</code> levels, with NAs in rows of A)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The order of the variables in the database have no importance but the column indexes related to the three columns previously described (ie ID, <code class="reqn">Y</code> and <code class="reqn">Z</code>) must be rigorously specified
in the argument <code>index_DB_Y_Z</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A set of shared common covariates (at least one but more is recommended) of any type, complete or not (provided that the number of covariates exceeds 1) is required.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The function <code>merge_dbs</code> is available in this package to assist user in the preparation of their databases, so please, do not hesitate to use it beforehand if necessary.
</p>
<p>Remarks about the target variables:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> A target variable can be of categorical type, but also discrete, stored in factor, ordered or not. Nevertheless, notice that, if the variable is stored in numeric it will be automatically converted in ordered factors.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If a target outcome is incomplete, the corresponding rows will be automatically dropped during the execution of the function.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The type of each variables (including <code class="reqn">ID</code>, <code class="reqn">Y</code> and <code class="reqn">Z</code>) of the database must be rigorously specified once, in one of the four arguments <code>quanti</code>,<code>nominal</code>, <code>ordinal</code> and <code>logic</code>.
</p>
<p>D. TRANSFORMATIONS OF CONTINUOUS COVARIATES
</p>
<p>The function <code>OT_outcome</code> integrates in its syntax a process dedicated to the categorization of continuous covariates. For this, it is necessary to rigorously fill in the arguments <code>convert.num</code> and <code>convert.class</code>.
The first one informs about the indexes in database of the continuous variables to transform in ordered factor while the second one specifies the corresponding number of desired balanced levels (for unbalanced levels, users must do transformations by themselves).
Therefore <code>convert.num</code> and <code>convert.class</code> must be vectors of same length, but if the length of <code>convert.num</code> exceeds 1, while the length of <code>convert.class</code> is 1, then, by default, all the covariates to convert will have the same number of classes,
that corresponds to the value specified in the argument <code>convert.class</code>.
Please notice that only covariates can be transformed (not outcomes) and missing informations are not taken into account for the transformations.
Moreover, all the indexes informed in the argument <code>convert.num</code> must also be informed in the argument <code>quanti</code>.
</p>
<p>E. INFORMATIONS ABOUT DISTANCE FUNCTIONS
</p>
<p>Each individual (or row) of a given database is here characterized by their covariates, so the distance between two individuals or groups of individuals depends on similarities between covariates
according to the distance function chosen by user (via the argument <code>dist.choice</code>). Actually four distance functions are implemented in <code>OT_outcome</code> to take into account the most frequently encountered situation (see (3)):
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> the Manhattan distance ("M")
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the Euclidean distance ("E")
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the Gower distance for mixed data (see (4): "G")
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the Hamming distance for binary data ("H")
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, it is also possible to directly apply the first three distances mentioned on coordinates extracted from a multivariate analysis (Factor Analysis for Mixed Data, see (5)) applied on raw covariates using the arguments <code>FAMD.coord</code> and <code>FAMD.perc</code>.
This method is used (1).
</p>
<p>As a decision rule, for a given profile of covariates <code class="reqn">P_j</code>, an individual <code class="reqn">i</code> will be considered as a neighbor of <code class="reqn">P_j</code> if <code class="reqn">dist(i,P_j) &lt; \mbox{prox.dist} \times max(dist(i,P_j))</code> where <code class="reqn">prox.dist</code> must be fixed by user.
</p>
<p>F. INFORMATIONS ABOUT THE SOLVER
</p>
<p>The argument <code>solvR</code> permits user to choose the solver of the optimization algorithm. The default solver is "glpk" that corresponds to the GNU Linear Programming Kit (see (6) for more details).
Moreover, the function actually uses the <code>R</code> optimization infrastructure of the package <span class="pkg">ROI</span> which offers a wide choice of solver to users by easily loading the associated plugins of <span class="pkg">ROI</span> (see (7)).
</p>
<p>For more details about the algorithms integrated in <code>OT_outcome</code>, please consult (1) and (2).

### Using a sample of simu_data dataset

### An example of OUTCOME algorithm that uses:
#-----
# - A nearest neighbor procedure for the estimation of individual predictions
# - The Manhattan distance function
# - 90% of individuals from each modalities to calculate average distances
#   between individuals and modalities
# Predictions are assessed for Y in B and Z in A

head(OUTC1$DATA1_OT) # Part of the completed database A
head(OUTC1$DATA2_OT) # Part of the completed database B

head(OUTC1$estimatorZA[, , 1])
# ... Corresponds to P[Z = 1|Y,P1] when P1 corresponds to the 1st profile of covariates (P_1)
# detailed in the 1st row of the profile object:
OUTC1$profile[1, ] # Details of P_1

# So estimatorZA[1,1,1]= 0.2 corresponds to an estimation of:
# P[Z = 1|Y=[20-40],Gender_2=0,Treatment_2=1,Treatment_3=0,Smoking_2=1,Dosage=3,Age=65.44]
# Thus, we can conclude that all individuals with the P_1 profile of covariates have
# 20% of chance to be affected to the 1st level of Z in database A.
# ... And so on, the reasoning is the same for the estimatorYB object.
