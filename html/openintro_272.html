<h2>Social experiment</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A "social experiment" conducted by a TV program questioned what people do
when they see a very obviously bruised woman getting picked on by her
boyfriend. On two different occasions at the same restaurant, the same
couple was depicted. In one scenario the woman was dressed "provocatively"
and in the other scenario the woman was dressed "conservatively". The table
below shows how many restaurant diners were present under each scenario, and
whether or not they intervened.
