<h2>Fish eDNA metabarcoding dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset of fish eDNA metabarcoding collected in the Kasumigaura watershed, Japan.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fish
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An occumbData class object containing the sequence read count <code>y</code>,
a species covariate <code>mismatch</code>, and a site covariate <code>riverbank</code>.
<code>mismatch</code> represents the total number of mismatched bases in the
priming region of the forward and reverse primers for each species.
<code>riverbank</code> indicates whether the riverbank at each site lacks aquatic
and riparian vegetation.
Sequence reads were obtained from three replicates (collected from the
center of the river and near the left and right riverbanks)
from 50 sites across the watershed, of which read counts from six samples were
missing.
The resulting sequence counts of 50 freshwater fish taxa were recorded.
