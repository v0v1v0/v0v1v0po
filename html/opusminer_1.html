<h2>Filtered Top-k Association Discovery of Self-Sufficient Itemsets</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>opusminer</code> package provides an R interface to the OPUS Miner
algorithm (implemented in C++), developed by Professor Geoffrey I Webb, for
finding the top <em>k</em>, non-redundant itemsets on the measure of interest.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>OPUS Miner is a branch-and-bound algorithm for efficient discovery of
self-sufficient itemsets. For a user-specified <em>k</em> and interest measure,
OPUS Miner finds the top <em>k</em> productive non-redundant itemsets with
respect to the specified measure. It is then straightforward to filter out
those that are not independently productive with respect to that set,
resulting in a set of self-sufficient itemsets.
</p>
<p>OPUS Miner is based on the OPUS search algorithm.  OPUS is a set enumeration
algorithm distinguished by a computationally efficient pruning mechanism that
ensures that whenever an item is pruned, it is removed from the entire search
space below the parent node.
</p>
<p>OPUS Miner systematically traverses viable regions of the search space (using
depth-first search), maintaining a collection of the top <em>k</em> productive
non-redundant itemsets in the search space explored. When all of the viable
regions have been explored, the top <em>k</em> productive non-redundant
itemsets in the search space explored must be the top <em>k</em> for the entire
search space.
</p>
<p>A comprehensive explanation of the algorithm is provided in the article cited
below.
