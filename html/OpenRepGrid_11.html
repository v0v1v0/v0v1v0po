<h2>Align constructs by loadings on first principal component.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In case a construct loads negatively on the first principal component, the function <code>alignByLoadings()</code> will reverse
it so that all constructs have positive loadings on the first principal component (see detail section for more).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">alignByLoadings(x, trim = 20, index = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>repgrid</code> object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trim</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of characters a construct is trimmed to (default is <code>10</code>). If <code>NA</code> no trimming is done.
Trimming simply saves space when displaying the output.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>index</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to print the number of the construct (e.g. for correlation matrices). The default is <code>TRUE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The direction of the constructs in a grid is arbitrary and a reflection of a scale does not affect the information
contained in the grid. Nonetheless, the direction of a scale has an effect on inter-element correlations (Mackay,
1992) and on the spatial representation and clustering of the grid (Bell, 2010). Hence, it is desirable to follow a
protocol to align constructs that will render unique results. A common approach is to align constructs by pole
preference, but this information is not always accessible. Bell (2010) proposed another solution for the problem of
construct alignment. As a unique protocol he suggests to align constructs in a way so they all have positive
loadings on the first component of a grid PCA.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>alignByLoadings</code> containing a list of calculations with the following entries:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>cor.before</code>: Construct correlation matrix before reversal
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>loadings.before</code>: Loadings on PCs before reversal
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>reversed</code>: Constructs that have been reversed
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>cor.after</code>: Construct correlation matrix after reversal
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>loadings.after</code>: Loadings on PCs after reversal
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Bell (2010) proposed a solution for the problem of construct alignment. As construct reversal has an effect on
element correlation and thus on any measure that based on element correlation (Mackay, 1992), it is desirable to
have a standard method for construct alignment independently from its semantics (preferred pole etc.). Bell (2010)
proposes to align constructs in a way so they all have positive loadings on the first component of a grid PCA.
