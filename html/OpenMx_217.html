<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A straightforward descriptive analysis of these data shows that negative responses are more numerous except on item 1; and that there is a positive association between each pair of items. A soldier who responds positively to any one item is more likely to respond positively to a second item. Lazarsfeld's analysis is based on the assumption that each soldier can be thought of as belong to one of two latent classes. The probability of positive response to an item is different in one group than in the other. Most importantly, he is willing to assume that for an individual respondent the responses to items are statistically independent.
