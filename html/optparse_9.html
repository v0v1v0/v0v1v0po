<h2>Command line option parser</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Goal is to create an R package of a command line parser inspired by Python's
“optparse” library.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>optparse</code> is primarily intended to be used with
“Rscript”. It facilitates writing “#!” shebang scripts that
accept short and long flags/options. It can also be used from directly, but
is probably less useful in this context.
</p>
<p>See package vignette for a more detailed example.
</p>
<p>Notes on naming convention in package: 1. An option is one of the shell-split
input strings. 2. A flag is a type of option. a flag can be defined as having
no argument (defined below), a required argument, or an optional argument. 3.
An argument is a type of option, and is the value associated with a flag. 4.
A long flag is a type of flag, and begins with the string “–”. If the
long flag has an associated argument, it may be delimited from the long flag
by either a trailing =, or may be the subsequent option. 5. A short flag is a
type of flag, and begins with the string “-”. If a short flag has an
associated argument, it is the subsequent option. short flags may be bundled
together, sharing a single leading “"-"”, but only the final short
flag is able to have a corresponding argument. %%%
