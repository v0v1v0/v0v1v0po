<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mydata</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame containing at least two numeric variables to plot.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of the x-variable to plot. Note that x can be a date field or a
factor. For example, <code>x</code> can be one of the <code>openair</code> built in
types such as <code>"year"</code> or <code>"season"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of the numeric y-variable to plot.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>z</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of the numeric z-variable to plot for <code>method = "scatter"</code>
or <code>method = "level"</code>. Note that for <code>method = "scatter"</code> points
will be coloured according to a continuous colour scale, whereas for
<code>method = "level"</code> the surface is coloured.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Methods include “scatter” (conventional scatter plot),
“hexbin” (hexagonal binning using the <code>hexbin</code> package).
“level” for a binned or smooth surface plot and “density” (2D
kernel density estimates).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>group</code></td>
<td>
<p>The grouping variable to use, if any. Setting this to a variable
in the data frame has the effect of plotting several series in the same
panel using different symbols/colours etc. If set to a variable that is a
character or factor, those categories or factor levels will be used
directly. If set to a numeric variable, it will split that variable in to
quantiles.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>avg.time</code></td>
<td>
<p>This defines the time period to average to. Can be
“sec”, “min”, “hour”, “day”, “DSTday”,
“week”, “month”, “quarter” or “year”. For much
increased flexibility a number can precede these options followed by a
space. For example, a timeAverage of 2 months would be <code>period = "2
  month"</code>. See function <code>timeAverage</code> for further details on this. This
option se useful as one method by which the number of points plotted is
reduced i.e. by choosing a longer averaging time.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data.thresh</code></td>
<td>
<p>The data capture threshold to use (\
the data using <code>avg.time</code>. A value of zero means that all available
data will be used in a particular period regardless if of the number of
values available. Conversely, a value of 100 will mean that all data will
need to be present for the average to be calculated, else it is recorded as
<code>NA</code>. Not used if <code>avg.time = "default"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>statistic</code></td>
<td>
<p>The statistic to apply when aggregating the data; default is
the mean. Can be one of "mean", "max", "min", "median", "frequency", "sd",
"percentile". Note that "sd" is the standard deviation and "frequency" is
the number (frequency) of valid records in the period. "percentile" is the
percentile level (\
"percentile" option - see below. Not used if <code>avg.time = "default"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>percentile</code></td>
<td>
<p>The percentile level in percent used when <code>statistic =
  "percentile"</code> and when aggregating the data with <code>avg.time</code>. The
default is 95. Not used if <code>avg.time = "default"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>type</code> determines how the data are split i.e. conditioned,
and then plotted. The default is will produce a single plot using the
entire data. Type can be one of the built-in types as detailed in
<code>cutData</code> e.g. “season”, “year”, “weekday” and so
on. For example, <code>type = "season"</code> will produce four plots — one for
each season.
</p>
<p>It is also possible to choose <code>type</code> as another variable in the data
frame. If that variable is numeric, then the data will be split into four
quantiles (if possible) and labelled accordingly. If type is an existing
character or factor variable, then those categories/levels will be used
directly. This offers great flexibility for understanding the variation of
different variables and how they depend on one another.
</p>
<p>Type can be up length two e.g. <code>type = c("season", "weekday")</code> will
produce a 2x2 plot split by season and day of the week. Note, when two
types are provided the first forms the columns and the second the rows.</p>

</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>smooth</code></td>
<td>
<p>A smooth line is fitted to the data if <code>TRUE</code>; optionally
with 95 percent confidence intervals shown. For <code>method = "level"</code> a
smooth surface will be fitted to binned data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>spline</code></td>
<td>
<p>A smooth spline is fitted to the data if <code>TRUE</code>. This is
particularly useful when there are fewer data points or when a connection
line between a sequence of points is required.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>linear</code></td>
<td>
<p>A linear model is fitted to the data if <code>TRUE</code>; optionally
with 95 percent confidence intervals shown. The equation of the line and R2
value is also shown.</p>

<td><code>ci</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should the confidence intervals for the smooth/linear fit be shown?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mod.line</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code> three lines are added to the scatter plot to
help inform model evaluation. The 1:1 line is solid and the 1:0.5 and 1:2
lines are dashed. Together these lines help show how close a group of
points are to a 1:1 relationship and also show the points that are within a
factor of two (FAC2). <code>mod.line</code> is appropriately transformed when x
or y axes are on a log scale.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cols</code></td>
<td>
<p>Colours to be used for plotting. Options include
“default”, “increment”, “heat”, “jet” and
<code>RColorBrewer</code> colours — see the <code>openair</code> <code>openColours</code>
function for more details. For user defined the user can supply a list of
colour names recognised by R (type <code>colours()</code> to see the full list).
An example would be <code>cols = c("yellow", "green", "blue")</code></p>

<p>The title of the key (if used).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>key.columns</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of columns to be used in the key. With many
pollutants a single column can make to key too wide. The user can thus
choose to use several columns by setting <code>columns</code> to be less than the
number of pollutants.</p>
</td>

</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>log.x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should the x-axis appear on a log scale? The default is
<code>FALSE</code>. If <code>TRUE</code> a well-formatted log10 scale is used. This can
be useful for checking linearity once logged.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>log.y</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should the y-axis appear on a log scale? The default is
<code>FALSE</code>. If <code>TRUE</code> a well-formatted log10 scale is used. This can
be useful for checking linearity once logged.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<td>
<p>The x-interval to be used for binning data when <code>method =

<td>
<p>The y-interval to be used for binning data when <code>method =
"level"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>limits</code></td>
<td>
<p>For <code>method = "level"</code> the function does its best to
choose sensible limits automatically. However, there are circumstances when
the user will wish to set different ones. The limits are set in the form
<code>c(lower, upper)</code>, so <code>limits = c(0, 100)</code> would force the plot
limits to span 0-100.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>windflow</code></td>
<td>
<p>This option allows a scatter plot to show the wind
speed/direction shows as an arrow. The option is a list e.g. <code>windflow
  = list(col = "grey", lwd = 2, scale = 0.1)</code>. This option requires wind
speed (<code>ws</code>) and wind direction (<code>wd</code>) to be available.
</p>
<p>The maximum length of the arrow plotted is a fraction of the plot dimension
with the longest arrow being <code>scale</code> of the plot x-y dimension. Note,
if the plot size is adjusted manually by the user it should be re-plotted
to ensure the correct wind angle. The list may contain other options to
<code>panel.arrows</code> in the <code>lattice</code> package. Other useful options
include <code>length</code>, which controls the length of the arrow head and
<code>angle</code>, which controls the angle of the arrow head.
</p>
<p>This option works best where there are not too many data to ensure
over-plotting does not become a problem.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y.relation</code></td>
<td>
<p>This determines how the y-axis scale is plotted.
“same” ensures all panels use the same scale and “free” will
use panel-specific scales. The latter is a useful setting when plotting
data with very different values.</p>

e.g. <code>ref.y = list(h = c(50, 100), lty = c(1, 5), col = c("green",
  "blue"))</code>. See <code>panel.abline</code> in the <code>lattice</code> package for more

<p>Other graphical parameters are passed onto <code>cutData</code> and an
appropriate <code>lattice</code> plot function (<code>xyplot</code>, <code>levelplot</code>
or <code>hexbinplot</code> depending on <code>method</code>). For example,
<code>scatterPlot</code> passes the option <code>hemisphere = "southern"</code> on to
<code>cutData</code> to provide southern (rather than default northern)
hemisphere handling of <code>type = "season"</code>. Similarly, for the default
case <code>method = "scatter"</code> common axis and title labelling options
(such as <code>xlab</code>, <code>ylab</code>, <code>main</code>) are passed to <code>xyplot</code>
via <code>quickText</code> to handle routine formatting. Other common graphical
parameters, e.g. <code>layout</code> for panel arrangement, <code>pch</code> for plot
symbol and <code>lwd</code> and <code>lty</code> for line width and type, as also
available (see examples below).
</p>
<p>For <code>method = "hexbin"</code> it can be useful to transform the scale if it
is dominated by a few very high values. This is possible by supplying two
functions: one that that applies the transformation and the other that
inverses it. For log scaling (the default) for example, <code>trans =
  function(x) log(x)</code> and <code>inv = function(x) exp(x)</code>. For a square root
transform use <code>trans = sqrt</code> and <code>inv = function(x) x^2</code>. To not
carry out any transformation the options <code>trans = NULL</code> and <code>inv
  = NULL</code> should be used.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>scatterPlot()</code> is the basic function for plotting scatter plots in flexible
ways in <code>openair</code>. It is flexible enough to consider lots of
conditioning variables and takes care of fitting smooth or linear
relationships to the data.
</p>
<p>There are four main ways of plotting the relationship between two variables,
which are set using the <code>method</code> option. The default <code>"scatter"</code>
will plot a conventional scatterPlot. In cases where there are lots of data
and over-plotting becomes a problem, then <code>method = "hexbin"</code> or
<code>method = "density"</code> can be useful. The former requires the
<code>hexbin</code> package to be installed.
</p>
<p>There is also a <code>method = "level"</code> which will bin the <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code> data according to the intervals set for <code>x.inc</code> and
<code>y.inc</code> and colour the bins according to levels of a third variable,
<code>z</code>. Sometimes however, a far better understanding of the relationship
between three variables (<code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code>) is gained by
fitting a smooth surface through the data. See examples below.
</p>
<p>A smooth fit is shown if <code>smooth = TRUE</code> which can help show the overall
form of the data e.g. whether the relationship appears to be linear or not.
Also, a linear fit can be shown using <code>linear = TRUE</code> as an option.
</p>
<p>The user has fine control over the choice of colours and symbol type used.
</p>
<p>Another way of reducing the number of points used in the plots which can
sometimes be useful is to aggregate the data. For example, hourly data can be
aggregated to daily data. See <code>timePlot()</code> for examples here.
</p>
<p>By default plots are shown with a colour key at the bottom and in the case of
conditioning, strips on the top of each plot. Sometimes this may be overkill
and the user can opt to remove the key and/or the strip by setting <code>key</code>
and/or <code>strip</code> to <code>FALSE</code>. One reason to do this is to maximise the
plotting area and therefore the information shown.
