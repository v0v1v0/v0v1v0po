<h2>Print the dependency tree for a given report using orderly log</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Investigate the dependency structure in a set of orderly reports.
This function allows the dependency graph to be created for set of
reports that have been run and committed (the archive) or of a set
of reports that could be run (the src) to be discovered and
printed to screen.  <em>This is experimental and somewhat subject to
change and improvement.</em>
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">orderly_graph(
  name,
  id = "latest",
  root = NULL,
  locate = TRUE,
  direction = "downstream",
  propagate = TRUE,
  max_depth = Inf,
  recursion_limit = 100,
  show_all = FALSE,
  use = "archive"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>name</code></td>
<td>
<p>the name of the report</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>id</code></td>
<td>
<p>the id of the report, if omitted, use the id of the
latest report</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>root</code></td>
<td>
<p>The path to an orderly root directory, or <code>NULL</code>
(the default) to search for one from the current working
directory if <code>locate</code> is <code>TRUE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>locate</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical, indicating if the configuration should be
searched for.  If <code>TRUE</code> and <code>config</code> is not given,
then orderly looks in the working directory and up through its
parents until it finds an <code>orderly_config.yml</code> file.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>direction</code></td>
<td>
<p>A string indicating if we want to move up or down
the tree permitted values are upstream, downstream</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>propagate</code></td>
<td>
<p>A boolean indicating if we want to propagate out
of date through the tree</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max_depth</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric, how far back should the tree go, this
can be useful to truncate a very large tree. (default = Inf)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>recursion_limit</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric, limit for depth of tree, if the tree
goes beyond this then an error is thrown. (default = 100)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>show_all</code></td>
<td>
<p>A boolean, should we show all reports in the tree,
not just the latest.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>use</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character string indicating what we read to infer the
dependency tree.  Current valid values are <code>archive</code> (the
default), which reads from archive reports and <code>src</code> which
reads from the source reports.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>orderly allows a report to rely on the artefacts of one or more
other orderly reports. This allows users to develop a network of
interconnected reports where the output from report becomes the
source of data for another.  There are two natural questions that
can develop around this workflow:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> We have updated a report; what are the reports that depend on
this so that we can re-run them?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> We have a report that we want to re-run to ensure uses the
latest information. Which other reports are used (directly or
indirectly) by this report?
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This function displays this information in an easily readable
format.  Allowing users to see the dependency tree and which
reports are out of date and need to be re-run.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An orderly tree object with the root corresponding to the given
report.
</p>


<h3>Remark</h3>

<p>By default the tree is built using data from the local report
database (see orderly_commit,
orderly_db). This means that it will not find changes
from a report that has not be run and committed. That is, if a
user changes a report to use or create different artefacts this
will not be picked up by the function until the reports are
re-run and committed to the archive.
</p>
<p>It is possible to generate a tree from the source reports by using
<code>use = "src"</code> - this generates the "theoretical tree", and has
no concept of being "up to date" or of ids.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p><em>This interface is considered experimental and may change without
notice</em>.  Please do not depend on it in scripts as it may break
things.  Consider this a (hopefully) useful way of exploring the
dependencies in your reports <em>interactively</em> - let us know what
is missing and we'll try and build it out.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">path &lt;- orderly::orderly_example("demo")

id &lt;- orderly::orderly_run("other", root = path, parameters=list(nmin=0))
orderly::orderly_commit(id, root = path)
id &lt;- orderly::orderly_run("use_dependency", root = path)
orderly::orderly_commit(id, root = path)
id &lt;- orderly::orderly_run("use_dependency_2", root = path)
orderly::orderly_commit(id, root = path)
orderly::orderly_graph("other", root = path)
orderly::orderly_graph("use_dependency_2", root = path,
                                 direction = "upstream")
