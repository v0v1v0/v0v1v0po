<h2>Microarray expression data on prostate cancer</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A subset of the microarray data from a study of prostate
cancer at Stanford is supplied as demo data with the
tail.rank.test package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(expression.data)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 2000 observations on the 112 variables.
Each column represent a different patient sample, as
described in the accompanying data.frame called
<code>clinical.info</code>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This data set contains normalized microarray expression
data on 2000 randomly selected genes from a prostate
cancer data set. The study was originially described
in a publication by Lapointe et al. The experiments
were performed on two-color glass microarrays printed
at Stanford and available from the Stanford Microarray
Database.  We downloaded the raw data and preprocessed
it. In particular,after background correction and loess
normalization, we computed log ratios between the channels.
We then randomly selected 2000 of the 42129 spots to
include as demonstration data here.
