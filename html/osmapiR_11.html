<h2>Retrieve map data by bounding box</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The following command returns:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> All nodes that are inside a given bounding box and any relations that reference them.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> All ways that reference at least one node that is inside a given bounding box, any relations that reference them
[the ways], and any nodes outside the bounding box that the ways may reference.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> All relations that reference one of the nodes, ways or relations included due to the above rules. (Does ”'not”'
apply recursively, see explanation below.)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">osm_bbox_objects(bbox, format = c("R", "xml", "json"), tags_in_columns = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bbox</code></td>
<td>
<p>Coordinates for the area to retrieve the map data from (<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠left,bottom,right,top⁠</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>format</code></td>
<td>
<p>Format of the output. Can be <code>"R"</code> (default), <code>"xml"</code>, or <code>"json"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tags_in_columns</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>FALSE</code> (default), the tags of the objects are saved in a single list column <code>tags</code>
containing a <code>data.frame</code> for each OSM object with the keys and values. If <code>TRUE</code>, add a column for each key.
Ignored if <code>format != "R"</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note that, while this command returns those relations that reference the aforementioned nodes and ways, the reverse
is not true: it does not (necessarily) return all of the nodes and ways that are referenced by these relations. This
prevents unreasonably-large result sets. For example, imagine the case where:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> There is a relation named "England" that references every node in England.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The nodes, ways, and relations are retrieved for a bounding box that covers a small portion of England.
While the result would include the nodes, ways, and relations as specified by the rules for the command, including
the "England" relation, it would (fortuitously) <strong>not</strong> include <strong>every</strong> node and way in England. If desired, the
nodes and ways referenced by the "England" relation could be retrieved by their respective IDs.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also note that ways which intersect the bounding box but have no nodes within the bounding box will not be returned.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If <code>format = "R"</code>, returns a data frame with one OSM object per row. If <code>format = "xml"</code>, returns a
xml2::xml_document following the
<a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_XML#OSM_XML_file_format_notes">OSM_XML format</a>. If <code>format = "json"</code>,
returns a list with a json structure following the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_JSON">OSM_JSON format</a>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>For downloading data for purposes other than editing or exploring the history of the objects, perhaps is better to
use the Overpass API. A similar function to download OSM objects using Overpass, is implemented in the
<span class="pkg">osmdata</span> function <code>opq()</code>.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">map_data &lt;- osm_bbox_objects(bbox = c(1.8366775, 41.8336843, 1.8379971, 41.8344537))
## bbox as a character value also works (bbox = "1.8366775,41.8336843,1.8379971,41.8344537").
