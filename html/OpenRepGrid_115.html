<h2>Percentage of Variance Accounted for by the First Factor (PVAFF)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The PVAFF is used as a measure of cognitive complexity. It was introduced in an unpublished PhD thesis by Jones
(1954, cit. Bonarius, 1965). To calculate it, the 'first factor' two different methods may be used. One applies
principal component analysis (PCA) to the construct centered raw data (default), the second applies SVD to the
construct correlation matrix. The PVAFF reflects the amount of variation that is accounted for by a single linear
component. If a single latent component is able to explain the variation in the grid, the cognitive complexity is
said to be low. In this case the construct system is regarded as 'simple' (Bell, 2003).
