<h2>avg_dist_closest()</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function computes average distances between levels of two categorical variables located in two distinct databases.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">avg_dist_closest(proxim, percent_closest = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>proxim</code></td>
<td>
<p>a <code>proxim_dist</code> object</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>percent_closest</code></td>
<td>
<p>a ratio between 0 and 1 corresponding to the desired part of rows (or statistical units, or individuals) that will participate to the computation of the average distances between levels of factors or
between an individual (a row) and levels of only one factor. Indeed, target variables are factors and each level of factor is characterized by a subset of rows, themselves characterized by their covariate profiles.
These rows can be ordered according to their distances at their factor level. When this ratio is set to 1 (default setting), all rows participate to the computation, nevertheless when this ratio is less than 1, only rows with
the smallest factor level distances will be kept for the computation (see 'Details').</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function <code>avg_dist_closest</code> is an intermediate function for the implementation of original algorithms dedicated to the solving of recoding problems in data fusion using Optimal Transportation theory (for more details, consult the corresponding algorithms called
<code>OUTCOME</code>, <code>R_OUTCOME</code>, <code>JOINT</code> and <code>R_JOINT</code>, in the reference (2)). The function <code>avg_dist_closest</code> is so directly implemented in the <code>OT_outcome</code> and <code>OT_joint</code> functions but can also be used separately.
The function <code>avg_dist_closest</code> uses, in particular, the distance matrix D (that stores distances between rows of A and B) from the function <code>proxim_dist</code> to produce three distinct matrices saved in a list object.
Therefore, the function requires in input, the specific output of the function <code>proxim_dist</code> which is available in the package and so must be used beforehand.
In consequence, do not use this function directly on your database, and do not hesitate to consult the provided examples provided for a better understanding.
</p>
<p>DEFINITION OF THE COST MATRIX
</p>
<p>Assuming that A and B are two databases with a set of shared variables and that a same information (referred to a same target population) is stored as a variable <code class="reqn">Y</code> in A and <code class="reqn">Z</code> in B, such that <code class="reqn">Y</code> is unknown in B and <code class="reqn">Z</code> is unknown in A, whose encoding depends on the database (<code class="reqn">n_Y</code> levels in A and <code class="reqn">n_Z</code> levels in B).
A distance between one given level y of <code class="reqn">Y</code> and one given level z of <code class="reqn">Z</code> is estimated by averaging the distances between the two subsets of individuals (units or rows) assigned to y in A and z in B, characterized by their vectors of covariates.
The distance between two individuals depends on the variations between the shared covariates, and so depends on the chosen distance function using the function <code>proxim_dist</code>.
For these computations, all the individuals concerned by these two levels can be taken into account, or only a part of them, depending on the argument <code>percent_closest</code>.
When <code>percent_closest</code> &lt; 1, the average distance between an individual <code class="reqn">i</code> and a given level of factor z only uses the corresponding part of individuals related to z that are the closest to <code class="reqn">i</code>.
Therefore, this choice influences the estimations of average distances between levels of factors but also permits to reduce time computation when necessary.
</p>
<p>The average distance between each individual of <code class="reqn">Y</code> (resp. <code class="reqn">Z</code>) and each levels of <code class="reqn">Z</code> (resp. <code class="reqn">Y</code>) are returned in output, in the object <code>DindivA</code> (<code>DindivB</code> respectively).
The average distance between each levels of <code class="reqn">Y</code> and each levels of <code class="reqn">Z</code> are returned in a matrix saved in output (the object <code>Davg</code>).
<code>Davg</code> returns the computation of the cost matrix D, whose dimensions (<code class="reqn">n_Y \times n_Z</code>) correspond to the number of levels of <code class="reqn">Y</code> (rows) and <code class="reqn">Z</code> (columns).
This matrix can be seen as the ability for an individual (row) to move from a given level of the target variable (<code class="reqn">Y</code>) in A to a given level of <code class="reqn">Z</code> in the database B (or vice versa).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of 3 matrices is returned:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Davg</code></td>
<td>
<p>the cost matrix whose number of rows corresponds to <code class="reqn">n_Y</code>, the number of levels of the target variable <code class="reqn">Y</code> in the database A, and whose number of columns corresponds to <code class="reqn">n_Z</code>: the number of levels of the target variable in B.
In this case, the related cost matrix can be interpreted as the ability to move from one level of <code class="reqn">Y</code> in A to one level of <code class="reqn">Z</code> in B.
Davg[P,Q] refers to the average distance between the modality P of <code class="reqn">Y</code> (only known in A) and modality <code class="reqn">Q</code> of <code class="reqn">Z</code> (only known in B).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>DindivA</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix whose number of rows corresponds to the number of rows of the first database A and number of columns corresponds to <code class="reqn">n_Z</code>, the number of levels of the target variable <code class="reqn">Z</code> in the second database B.
DindivA[i,Q] refers to the average distance between the <code class="reqn">i^{th}</code> individual (or row) of the first database and a chosen proportion of individuals (<code>percent_closest</code> set by the user) of the second database having the modality <code class="reqn">Q</code> of <code class="reqn">Z</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>DindivB</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix whose number of rows corresponds to the number of rows of the second database B and number of columns corresponds to nA, the number of levels of the target variable in the first database A.
DindivB[k,P] refers to the average distance between the <code class="reqn">k^{th}</code> individual (or row) of the second database and a chosen proportion of individuals (depending on <code>percent_closest</code>) of the first database having the modality P of <code class="reqn">Y</code>.</p>

# proxim_dist() fixes the chosen distance function,
# and defines neighborhoods between profiles and individuals

# The following row uses only 80 percents of individuals of each level
