<h2>Example wave records</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing pressure records and derived sea surface height  
from a bottom-mounted pressure transducer data logger deployed at 
Marguerite Reef near Los Angeles, CA, USA. The device was deployed at 
a depth of approximately 10 meters, and sea level air pressure was 
1014 mbar at the time of deployment. The pressure data logger was 
mounted approximately 10 cm above the benthos. Sampling rate was 4 Hz, 
so the total record represents 30 minutes of time.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">wavedata
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 7200 rows and 4 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>DateTime</dt>
<dd>
<p>Date and time, with fractional seconds. UTC time zone.</p>
</dd>
<dt>absPressure.mbar</dt>
<dd>
<p>Absolute pressure recorded by the data logger, in 
units of millibar (1 mbar = 100 Pascal). This value includes pressure
due to the atmosphere above the sea surface, which was 1014 mbar during the
deployment.</p>
</dd>
<dt>swPressure.mbar</dt>
<dd>
<p>Pressure produced by the column of seawater 
above the data logger. 
The pressure due to the atmosphere above the sea surface has been subtracted
off of the absolute pressure value absPressure.mbar to produce this value. 
Units of mbar.</p>
</dd>
<dt>swDepth.m</dt>
<dd>
<p>Estimated depth in meters of the seawater column above the
pressure data logger, converted from the swPressure.mbar value.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
