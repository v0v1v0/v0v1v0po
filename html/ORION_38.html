<h2>Overview Subcascades</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>summarySubcascades</code> returns a summarizing overview. For each length the number of cascades and the minimal class-wise sensitivity is given.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">summarySubcascades(subcascades = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>subcascades</code></td>
<td>
<p>A Subcascades object as it is returned by <code>subcascades</code>-function.
The Subcascades object is made up of a list of matrices. 
Each matrix comprises the evaluation results of cascades of a specific length and 
is sorted row-wise according to the achieved minimal classwise sensitivities of the cascades (decreasing).
The rownames show the class order by a character string of type '1&gt;2&gt;3' and the entries the sensitivity for each position of the cascade.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function gives an overview of the Subcascades object. For each length in 
the Subcascades object the number of cascades of that length, as well as their 
minimal classwise sensitivity is given.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix summarizing the overview characteristics of the Subcascades object. 
For each size (rows) the number of cascades within the Subcascades object (number) and the minimal classwise sensitivity (min.class.sens) are given.
