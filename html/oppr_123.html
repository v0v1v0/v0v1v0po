<h2>oppr: Optimal Project Prioritization</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <span class="pkg">oppr</span> <em>R</em> package a decision support tool for prioritizing
conservation projects. Prioritizations can be developed by maximizing
expected feature richness, expected
phylogenetic diversity, the number of features that meet persistence
targets, or identifying a set of projects that meet persistence targets
for minimal cost. Constraints (e.g. lock in
specific actions) and feature weights can also be specified to further
customize prioritizations. After defining a project prioritization
problem, solutions can be obtained using exact algorithms, heuristic
algorithms, or random processes. In particular, it is recommended to
install the 'Gurobi' optimizer (available from
<a href="https://www.gurobi.com">https://www.gurobi.com</a>)
because it can identify optimal solutions very quickly. Finally, methods
are provided for comparing different prioritizations and evaluating their
benefits.

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>To make the most of this package, the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ggtree.html"><span class="pkg">ggtree</span></a> and
<a href="https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/8.1/refman/r_api_overview.html"><span class="pkg">gurobi</span></a> R packages will need to be installed.
Since the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ggtree.html"><span class="pkg">ggtree</span></a> package is exclusively available
at <a href="https://bioconductor.org">Bioconductor</a>—and is not available on
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">The Comprehensive R Archive Network</a>—please
execute the following command to install it:
<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R");biocLite("ggtree")⁠</code>.
If the installation process fails, please consult the
<a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ggtree.html">package's online documentation</a>. To install the <span class="pkg">gurobi</span> package, the
<a href="https://www.gurobi.com">Gurobi</a> optimization suite will first need to
be installed (see instructions for <a href="https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/8.1/quickstart_linux/software_installation_guid.html">Linux</a>,
<a href="https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/8.1/quickstart_mac/software_installation_guid.html">Mac OSX</a>, and
<a href="https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/8.1/quickstart_windows/software_installation_guid.html">Windows</a> operating systems). Although
<a href="https://www.gurobi.com">Gurobi</a> is a commercial software, academics
can obtain a
<a href="https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/end-user-license-agreement-academic/">special license for no cost</a>. After installing the
<a href="https://www.gurobi.com">Gurobi</a> optimization suite, the <span class="pkg">gurobi</span>
package can then be installed (see instructions for <a href="https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/8.1/quickstart_linux/r_installing_the_r_package.html">Linux</a>,
<a href="https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/8.1/quickstart_mac/r_installing_the_r_package.html">Mac OSX</a>, and
<a href="https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/8.1/quickstart_windows/r_installing_the_r_package.html">Windows</a> operating systems).
