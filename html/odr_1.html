<h2>Optimal Design and Statistical Power for Experimental Studies
Investigating Main, Mediation, and Moderation Effects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package is to help researchers design cost-efficient and well-powered
experimental studies investigating main, mediation, and moderation
effects (and some combinations). Specifically, this package can
(a) identify optimal sample allocations,
(b) compare design efficiency between different sample allocations,
and (c) perform power analyses with and without
accommodating costs and budget.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package covers seven types of experiments aiming to detect
main, moderation, and mediation effects. These experiments are
individual randomized controlled trials (RCTs), two-,
three-, and four-level cluster-randomized trials (CRTs),
two-, three-, and four-level multisite randomized trials (MRTs).
The two categorical functions are
'od' and 'power'. The 'od' function can
calculate the optimal sample allocation with and without constraint for
each type of experiments.
The 'power' function by default can calculate required budget
(and required sample size) for desired
power, minimum detectable effect size (MDES) under a fixed budget,
statistical power under a fixed budget.
The 'power' function can perform conventional power analyses
(e.g., required sample size, power, MDES calculation).
The uniform function 're' (or 'rpe') is to compare
the relative (precision and) efficiency between two designs
with different sample allocations (limited to main effects).
