<h2>Fish eDNA metabarcoding dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset of fish eDNA metabarcoding collected in the Kasumigaura watershed, Japan.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fish_raw
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list containing an array of sequence read count, <code>y</code>,
a vector of the total number of mismatched bases in the priming region of
the forward and reverse primers for each species, <code>mismatch</code>,
and a factor indicating whether the riverbank at each site lacked aquatic
and riparian vegetation, <code>riverbank</code>.
Sequence reads were obtained from three replicates (collected from the
center of the river and near the left and right riverbanks)
from 50 sites across the watershed, of which read counts from six samples were
missing.
The resulting sequence counts of 50 freshwater fish taxa detected were
recorded.
