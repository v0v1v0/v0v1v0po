<h2>Gender, Socioeconomic Class, and Interview Invites</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Resumes were sent out to 316 top law firms in the United States, and there
were two randomized characteristics of each resume. First, the gender
associated with the resume was randomized by assigning a first name of
either James or Julia. Second, the socioeconomic class of the candidate was
randomly assigned and represented through five minor changes associated with
personal interests and other other minor details (e.g. an extracurricular
activity of sailing team vs track and field). The outcome variable was
whether the candidate was received an interview.
