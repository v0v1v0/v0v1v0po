<h2>Recursively Expand Symbols in Quoted Language</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Finds symbols in quoted R language objects and recursively replaces them with
any language objects that those symbols point to.  This leads to an expanded
language object that can be evaluated.  Language objects are objects of type
"symbol", "language", or "expression", though only unclassed language
is expanded by default.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">expand(expr, envir = parent.frame(), enclos = if (is.list(envir) ||
  is.pairlist(envir)) parent.frame() else baseenv(),
  class.shield = getOption("oshka.class.shield"),
  name.shield = getOption("oshka.name.shield"))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>expr</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object to be evaluated.  See ‘Details’.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>envir</code></td>
<td>
<p>the <code>environment</code> in which <code>expr</code> is to
be evaluated.  May also be <code>NULL</code>, a list, a data frame,
a pairlist or an integer as specified to <code>sys.call</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>enclos</code></td>
<td>
<p>Relevant when <code>envir</code> is a (pair)list or a data frame.
Specifies the enclosure, i.e., where <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> looks for objects not found
in <code>envir</code>.  This can be <code>NULL</code> (interpreted as the base
package environment, <code>baseenv()</code>) or an environment.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>class.shield</code></td>
<td>
<p>TRUE, FALSE, or character, determines what portions of
quoted language are shielded from expansion.  TRUE, the default, means that
any any classed language (e.g. formula) will be left unexpanded.  If FALSE
all language will be expanded, irrespective of class.  If character, then
any classed objects with classes in the vector will be left unexpanded, and
all others will be expanded.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>name.shield</code></td>
<td>
<p>character names of symbols that should not be expanded,
which by default is <code>c("::", ":::")</code>.  If position 1 in a call (i.e. the
function name)  is a name in this list , then the entire call is left
unexpanded.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If the input is a language object, that object with all symbols
recursively expanded, otherwise the input unchanged.
</p>


<h3>Programmable NSE</h3>

<p>The expansion can be used to implement programmable Non-Standard Evaluation
(NSE hereafter).  Users can create complex quoted language expressions from
simple ones by combining them as they would tokens in standard R expressions.
Then, a programmable NSE aware function can use <code>expand</code> to turn the quoted
language into usable form.  See examples.
</p>


<h3>Expansion mechanics</h3>

<p>During the recursive expansion, symbols are looked up through the search
path in the same way as standard R evaluation looks up symbols.  One subtlety
is that if symbol A expands to a language object B, the symbols in
language object B are looked for starting from the environment that A is
bound to, not the initial evaluation environment.  Expansion stops at symbols
that point to non-language objects.
</p>
<p>Symbols at the first position in calls (e.g. <code>fun</code> in <code>fun(x, y)</code>) are
expanded slightly differently: they will continue to be expanded until an
object of mode "function" is found.  This is to follow the semantics of
symbol searches in R where a symbol pointing to a non-function object will
not mask a symbol pointing to a function object when it is used as the name
of the function in a call.
</p>
<p>You can prevent expansion on portions of language via shielding.  Some
language is not expanded by default (see next section).
</p>


<h3>Shielding</h3>

<p>There are two mechanisms for shielding language from expansion.  The first
one is to give language a class.  This is why formulas are not expanded by
default.  Be careful though that you do not give a symbol a class as that is
bad practice and will become an R runtime error in the future.
</p>
<p>The second mechanism is to specify symbol names that should not be expanded.
This is easier to specify than the class based mechanism, but it is less
precise as it applies to all instances of that name.  By default the symbols
"::" and ":::" are not expanded.  If a function call has a shielded symbol
for function name the <em>entire</em> call will be shielded.
</p>
<p>See the <code>class.shield</code> and <code>name.shield</code> parameters, and examples.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">xzw &lt;- uvt &lt;- NULL  # make sure not lang objects
aaa &lt;- quote(xzw &gt; 3)
bbb &lt;- quote(xzw &lt; 10)
ccc &lt;- quote(aaa &amp; bbb)
expand(ccc)

## You can place list like objects in the search path
l &lt;- list(bbb=quote(uvt &lt; 9999))
expand(ccc, l)

## But notice what happens if we use `quote(ccc)` instead of
## just `ccc`.  This is because in this case `expand` must
## look for the `ccc` symbol in the search path, and once
## it finds it it looks for `aaa` and `bbb` starting from the
## environment `ccc` is bound to, so the `bbb` defined
## inside `l` is skipped.
expand(quote(ccc), l)

## Implementing an NSE fun (see vignettes for detailed
## examples)
subset2 &lt;- function(x, subset) {
  subset &lt;- expand(substitute(subset), x, parent.frame())
  eval(bquote(base::subset(.(x), .(subset))), parent.frame())
}
subset2(iris, Sepal.Width &gt; 4.3)
iris.sub &lt;- quote(Sepal.Width &gt; 4.3)
subset2(iris, iris.sub)

## You can shield all instances of a symbol from expansion.
## Note we append existing name shield list.

expand(ccc, name.shield=c(getOption('oshka.name.shield'), 'bbb'))

## You can also shield by attaching classes to language
## objects or portions thereof
expand(I(ccc))  # add the `AsIs` class to `ccc` with `I`
expand(ccc)

## If you wish to shield a symbol with this method you
## cannot do so directly.  Note the `quote((bbb))` as 
## otherwise we would attach attributes to a symbol:
ccd &lt;- bquote(aaa &amp; .(I(quote((bbb)))))
expand(ccd)

## Equivalently
cce &lt;- ccc
cce[[3]] &lt;- I(quote((bbb)))
expand(cce)

## Formulas not expanded by default, but can be forced
## to expand by setting `class.shield` to FALSE
expand(aaa ~ bbb)
expand(aaa ~ bbb, class.shield=FALSE)
