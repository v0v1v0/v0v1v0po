<h2>imxGetNumThreads</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is an internal function exported for those people who know
what they are doing.
</p>
<p>This function hard codes responses to a set of environments, like detecting snowfall,
or running on a cluster where "OMP_NUM_THREADS" is set or otherwise returning 1 or 2 cores
to avoid consuming all the resources on CRAN's test machines during release cycles.
</p>
<p>This makes it <em>not</em> suitable for getting the number of available threads.
</p>
<p>To get the number of cores available locally you want <code>omxDetectCores</code>
or perhaps the <code>detectCores</code> function in the parallel package.
</p>
