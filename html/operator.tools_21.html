<h2>Registers an operator for use with operator.tools package.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>setOperator</code> registers a user-defined operator as a given type.
Subsequently, this operator can be treated as a member of a class of
operators.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">setOperator(name, type = "user", ...)

setOperators(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>name</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector containing the <b>names</b> of one or more
functions which will be registered.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>The type of operator. See Details.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>setOperators</code> scans defined functions looking for any that have been
defined by the user using the special <code>any</code> syntax.  If found, these
are registered with <code>setOperator</code> and given the default type='user'.
</p>
<p><code>setOperator</code> registers a single operator similar to the way that
<code>setMethod</code> registers a method.  The definition for these operators are
defined by <code>.Options$operators</code>.
</p>
<p><code>setOperators</code> scans the environments for user-defined operators. If
found and not already registered, these are registered by
<code>setOperator</code>. Registered operators are much more efficient than
unregisted ones, so it is often advantageous to register the operators. When
<code>...</code> is supplied, these attributes are set for all unregistered
operators.
</p>
<p>Operators are allowed to have attributes. The one required attribute is
<code>type</code>, which is just a character value that serves to classification
the operator.  On package load, All operators from base R are assigned a
core type as specified in Syntax.  These are: namespace,
component, indexing, sequence, arithmetic, arithmetic, relational, logical,
tilde, assignment, help.
</p>
<p>Users may use one of these types or assign a type of their own choosing. The
<code>type</code> is largely unrestricted, but cannot be one of the reserved
operator groupings: ALL, REG(ISTERED), UNREG(ISTERED), SPECIAL or user.
These have special meaning as described in <code>operators</code>. Users
are encouraaged to make their own types in lower case.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>None. This function exists for assigning a operator to
<code>options('operators')</code>.
