<h2>Sample Multivariate Trait Data (Pitcher Plants)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data represent a subset of trait information collected on carnivorous pitchers of the Northern Pitcher plant, *Sarracenia purpurea*,
across the species' native North American latitudinal range 30.197°N-53.722°N (Freedman et al. 2021).
We provide data from 5 sites out of the 36 sites sampled.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pitcher_traits
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>data.frame</code> with 120 rows and 9 columns.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Pitcher traits measured include:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> orthogonal rosette diameters: the length of the widest part of the basal rosette and the longest length of the basal rosette that is perpendicular to the length of the widest part of the basal rosette
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> pitcher length: for the randomly selected pitcher selected for measurement this represents the length from the base of the pitcher (near the rosette of the individual plant) up to the topmost part of the pitcher
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> pitcher width: length of the widest part of the pitcher randomly selected for measurement
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> keel width: length of the widest part of the keel (the lobe that runs from the pitcher opening to the base on the front side of the pitcher)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> mouth diameter: the length of the widest part of the pitcher opening
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> lip thickness: the length of the thickness of the pitcher at its opening
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>See Ellison and Gotelli (2002) for a diagram illustrating traits measured.
