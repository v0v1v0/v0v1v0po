<h2>Problem objective</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An objective is used to specify the overall goal of a project prioritization
<code>problem()</code>. All project prioritization problems involve
minimizing or maximizing some kind of objective. For instance, the decision
maker may require a funding scheme that maximizes the total number of
species that are expected to persist into the future whilst ensuring that
the total cost of the funded actions does not exceed a budget.
Alternatively, the planner may require a solution that ensures that
each species meets a target level of persistence whilst minimizing the cost
of  the funded actions. A project prioritization
<code>problem()</code> <strong>must</strong> have a specified objective before it can
be solved, and attempting to solve a problem which does not have
a specified objective will throw an error.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The following objectives can be added to a conservation planning
<code>problem()</code>:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>add_max_richness_objective()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Maximize the total number of features that are expected to persist,
whilst ensuring that the cost of the solution is within a pre-specified
budget (Joseph, Maloney &amp; Possingham 2009).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>add_max_targets_met_objective()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Maximize the total number of persistence targets met for the features,
whilst ensuring that the cost of the solution is within a pre-specified
budget (Chades <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>add_max_phylo_div_objective()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Maximize the phylogenetic diversity that is expected to persist into the
future, whilst ensuring that the cost of the solution is within a
pre-specified budget (Bennett <em>et al.</em> 2014, Faith 2008).</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>add_min_set_objective()</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Minimize the cost of the solution whilst ensuring that all targets are
met. This objective is conceptually similar to that used in <em>Marxan</em>
(Ball, Possingham &amp; Watts 2009).</p>
</dd>
