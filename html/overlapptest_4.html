<h2>
P Value for a  Monte Carlo Test of Polygon Overlapping
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes the p-value and sign of deviation for the hypothesis that  the first value in a vector  is larger or smaller (i.e., a two-sided test)  than the expected value represented by all the other values in the vector, or alternatively, computes a one-sided test.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pval(x, alternative=c("two.sided", "less", "greater"))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector, usually with some observed statistic in the first position (the observed overlapp) followed by a sequence of the same statistic computed for several realizations of a null model against which we test our hypothesis (i.e., a sequence of simulated, i.e., rotated, overlapps).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alternative</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis, must be one of "two.sided" (default), "greater" or "less". You can specify just the initial letter.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Vector of length one whose absolute value represents the p-value and whose sign indicates wether the first value in <code>x</code> is larger (positive) or smaller (negative) than the expected value.
