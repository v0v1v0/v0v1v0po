<h2>Return structure of matched sets</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Tabulate treatment:control ratios occurring in matched sets, and
the frequency of their occurrence.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A table showing frequency of occurrence of those
treatment:control ratios that occur.
</p>
<p>The ‘effective sample size’ of the stratification, in
matched pairs.  Given as an attribute of the table, named
‘<code>comparable.num.matched.pairs</code>’; see Note.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>For comparing treatment and control groups both of size 10,
say, a stratification consisting of two strata, one with 9
treatments and 1 control, has a smaller ‘effective sample
size’, intuitively, than a stratification into 10 matched pairs,
despite the fact that both contain 20 subjects in
total. <code>stratumStructure</code> first summarizes this aspect of
the structure of the stratification it is given, then goes on to
identify one number as the stratification's effective sample
size.  The ‘<code>comparable.num.matched.pairs</code>’
attribute returned by <code>stratumStructure</code> is the sum of
harmonic means of the sizes of the treatment and control
subgroups of each stratum, a general way of calibrating such
differences as well as differences in the number of subjects
contained in a stratification.  For example, by this metric the
9:1, 1:9 stratification is comparable to 3.6 matched pairs.
</p>
<p>Why should effective sample size be calculated this way?  The
phrase ‘effective sample size’ suggests the observations
are taken to be similar in information content.  Modeling them
as random variables, this suggests that they be assumed to have
the same variance, <code class="reqn">\sigma</code>, conditional on what
stratum they reside in.  If that is the case, and if also
treatment and control observations differ in expectation by a
constant that is the same for each stratum, then it can be shown
that the optimum weights with which to combine treatment-control
contrasts across strata, <code class="reqn">s</code>, are proportional to the
stratum-wise harmonic means of treatment and control counts,
<code class="reqn">h_s = [(n_{ts}^{-1} + n_{cs}^{-1})/2]^{-1}</code> (Kalton, 1968).  The thus-weighted
average of contrasts then has variance <code class="reqn">2\sigma/\sum_s
  h_s</code>. This motivates the use of <code class="reqn">\sum_s
  h_s</code> as a measure of effective sample size (Hansen, 2011).
Somewhat different motivations of the same calculation appear 
in Hansen (2004) and in Hansen and Bowers (2008).  Since for a
matched pair <code class="reqn">s</code>, <code class="reqn">h_s=1</code>, <code class="reqn">\sum_s
  h_s</code> can be thought of as the number of matched pairs
needed to attain comparable precision.
