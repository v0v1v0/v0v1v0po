<h2>Add a SYMPHONY solver with <span class="pkg">Rsymphony</span>
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Specify that the <em>SYMPHONY</em> software should be used to solve a
project prioritization <code>problem()</code> using the <span class="pkg">Rsymphony</span>
package. This function can also be used to customize the behavior of the
solver. It requires the <span class="pkg">Rsymphony</span> package.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_rsymphony_solver(
  x,
  gap = 0,
  time_limit = .Machine$integer.max,
  first_feasible = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>ProjectProblem object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gap</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>numeric</code> gap to optimality. This gap is relative
and expresses the acceptable deviance from the optimal objective.
For example, a value of 0.01 will result in the solver stopping when
it has found a solution within 1% of optimality.
Additionally, a value of 0 will result in the solver stopping
when it has found an optimal solution.
The default value is 0.1 (i.e. 10% from optimality).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time_limit</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>numeric</code> time limit in seconds to run the optimizer.
The solver will return the current best solution when this time limit is
exceeded.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>first_feasible</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>logical</code> should the first feasible solution be
be returned? If <code>first_feasible</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code>, the solver
will return the first solution it encounters that meets all the
constraints, regardless of solution quality. Note that the first feasible
solution is not an arbitrary solution, rather it is derived from the
relaxed solution, and is therefore often reasonably close to optimality.
Defaults to <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>logical</code> should information be printed while solving
optimization problems?</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/coin-or/SYMPHONY"><em>SYMPHONY</em></a> is an
open-source integer programming solver that is part of the Computational
Infrastructure for Operations Research (COIN-OR) project, an initiative
to promote development of open-source tools for operations research (a
field that includes linear programming). The <span class="pkg">Rsymphony</span> package
provides an interface to COIN-OR and is available on <em>CRAN</em>.
This solver uses the <span class="pkg">Rsymphony</span> package to solve problems.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>ProjectProblem object with the solver added
to it.
