<h2>Summary of movement direction for Oregon RFID antenna data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Summarizes the time difference between the first and last movement directions for each unique tag ID. Input data are created by <code>tag_direction</code>, which determines the direction of movement for each detection event in <code>join_multireader_data</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">direction_summary(dir_df, include_stationary = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dir_df</code></td>
<td>
<p>output from <code>tag_direction</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>include_stationary</code></td>
<td>
<p>if <em>TRUE</em>, all detections are summarized. If FALSE, only detections with a known movement direction (up or down) are included in the summary.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>direction_summary</code> isolates the first and last direction of movement from <code>tag_direction</code> and determines the time difference in seconds and days. Directions are U for upstream movement, D for downstream movement, and S for no movement, or consecutive detection at the same location.
</p>
<p>It is common for a tag to be detected multiple times at the same antenna, which will result in a movement direction of S, or stationary. The user is encouraged to examine direction summaries for <em>include_stationary = TRUE</em> and <em>include_stationary = FALSE</em> to become familiar with their data. When <em>include_stationary = FALSE</em>, there may be fewer tag ids in the direction summary than in the full data set.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a tibble object.
