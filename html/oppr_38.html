<h2>Add minimum set objective</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Set the objective of a project prioritization <code>problem()</code> to
minimize the cost of the solution whilst ensuring that all targets are met.
This objective is conceptually similar to that used in <em>Marxan</em>
(Ball, Possingham &amp; Watts 2009).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A problem objective is used to specify the overall goal of the
project prioritization problem.
Here, the minimum set objective seeks to find the set of actions that
minimizes the overall cost of the prioritization, while ensuring that the
funded projects meet a set of persistence targets for the conservation
features (e.g. populations, species, ecosystems). Let <code class="reqn">I</code> represent
the set of conservation actions (indexed by <code class="reqn">i</code>). Let <code class="reqn">C_i</code> denote
the cost for funding action <code class="reqn">i</code>. Also, let <code class="reqn">F</code> represent each
feature (indexed by <code class="reqn">f</code>), <code class="reqn">T_f</code> represent the persistence target
for feature <code class="reqn">f</code>, and <code class="reqn">E_f</code> denote the probability that each
feature will go extinct given the funded conservation projects.
</p>
<p>To guide the prioritization, the conservation actions are organized into
conservation projects. Let <code class="reqn">J</code> denote the set of conservation projects
(indexed by <code class="reqn">j</code>), and let <code class="reqn">A_{ij}</code> denote which actions
<code class="reqn">i \in I</code> comprise each conservation project
<code class="reqn">j \in J</code> using zeros and ones. Next, let <code class="reqn">P_j</code> represent
the probability of project <code class="reqn">j</code> being successful if it is funded. Also,
let <code class="reqn">B_{fj}</code> denote the enhanced probability that each feature
<code class="reqn">f \in F</code> associated with the project <code class="reqn">j \in J</code>
will persist if all of the actions that comprise project <code class="reqn">j</code> are funded
and that project is allocated to feature <code class="reqn">f</code>.
For convenience,
let <code class="reqn">Q_{fj}</code> denote the actual probability that each
<code class="reqn">f \in F</code> associated with the project <code class="reqn">j \in J</code>
is expected to persist if the project is funded. If the argument
to <code>adjust_for_baseline</code> in the <code>problem</code> function was set to
<code>TRUE</code>, and this is the default behavior, then
<code class="reqn">Q_{fj} = (P_{j} \times B_{fj}) + \bigg(\big(1 - (P_{j} B_{fj})\big)
  \times (P_{n} \times B_{fn})\bigg)</code>, where <code>n</code> corresponds to the
baseline "do nothing" project. This means that the probability
of a feature persisting if a project is allocated to a feature
depends on (i) the probability of the project succeeding, (ii) the
probability of the feature persisting if the project does not fail,
and (iii) the probability of the feature persisting even if the project
fails. Otherwise, if the argument is set to <code>FALSE</code>, then
<code class="reqn">Q_{fj} = P_{j} \times B_{fj}</code>.
</p>
<p>The binary control variables <code class="reqn">X_i</code> in this problem indicate whether
each project <code class="reqn">i \in I</code> is funded or not. The decision
variables in this problem are the <code class="reqn">Y_{j}</code>, <code class="reqn">Z_{fj}</code>, and <code class="reqn">E_f</code>
variables.
Specifically, the binary <code class="reqn">Y_{j}</code> variables indicate if project <code class="reqn">j</code>
is funded or not based on which actions are funded; the binary
<code class="reqn">Z_{fj}</code> variables indicate if project <code class="reqn">j</code> is used to manage
feature <code class="reqn">f</code> or not; and the semi-continuous <code class="reqn">E_f</code> variables
denote the probability that feature <code class="reqn">f</code> will go extinct.
</p>
<p>Now that we have defined all the data and variables, we can formulate
the problem. For convenience, let the symbol used to denote each set also
represent its cardinality (e.g. if there are ten features, let <code class="reqn">F</code>
represent the set of ten features and also the number ten).

<p>The objective (eqn 1a) is to minimize the cost of the funded actions.
Constraints (eqn 1b) ensure that the persistence targets are met.
Constraints (eqn 1c) calculate the probability that each feature
will go extinct according to their allocated project.
Constraints (eqn 1d) ensure that feature can only be allocated to projects
that have all of their actions funded. Constraints (eqn 1e) state that each
feature can only be allocated to a single project. Constraints (eqn 1f)
ensure that a project cannot be funded unless all of its actions are
funded. Constraints (eqns 1g) ensure that the probability variables
(<code class="reqn">E_f</code>) are bounded between zero and one. Constraints (eqns 1h) ensure
that the action funding (<code class="reqn">X_i</code>), project funding (<code class="reqn">Y_j</code>), and
project allocation (<code class="reqn">Z_{fj}</code>) variables are binary.
