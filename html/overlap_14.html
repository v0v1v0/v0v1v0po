Calculates the true coefficient of overlapping between two distributions.

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the true coefficient of overlapping between two distributions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">overlapTrue(d1, d2 = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>d1</code></td>
<td>

<p>either a vector or a 2-column matrix of densities for equidistant points from 0 to <code class="reqn">2\pi</code>; if densities for both 0 and <code class="reqn">2\pi</code> are included (and are equal), one will be ignored.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>d2</code></td>
<td>

<p>a vector of densities as for d1; ignored if d1 is a matrix
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The coefficient of overlapping <code class="reqn">\Delta</code> for two probability density functions <em>f(x)</em> and <em>g(x)</em> is given by:

If the two curves in the plot below represent activity patterns of two species, the coefficient of overlapping is the area under the lower of the two curves, shaded grey in the figure:

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The coefficient of overlap of the two distributions. The function is intended to calculate true overlap for simulated data. If the densities provided are fitted kernel densities, an estimate of overlap results.
