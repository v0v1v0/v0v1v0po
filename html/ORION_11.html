<h2>Filter Subcascades</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>keepSets</code> filters specific cascade sets.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">keepSets(
  subcascades = NULL,
  sets = NULL,
  direction = "sub",
  ordered = FALSE,
  neighborhood = "direct",
  type = "any"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>subcascades</code></td>
<td>
<p>A Subcascades object as it is returned by <code>subcascades</code>-function.
The Subcascades object is made up of a list of matrices. 
Each matrix comprises the evaluation results of cascades of a specific length and 
is sorted row-wise according to the achieved minimal classwise sensitivities of the cascades (decreasing).
The rownames show the class order by a character string of type '1&gt;2&gt;3' and the entries the sensitivity for each position of the cascade.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sets</code></td>
<td>
<p>Contains the set used for filtering. It is either a list of numeric vectors, a numeric vector, 
or a vector of characters representing a cascade of the following format '1&gt;2&gt;4'. Empty vectors are not allowed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>direction</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either 'sub','super' or 'exact', indicating whether the subset, the superset or the exact set is filtered. 
The 'exact' case filters exactly the cascades defined in <code>sets</code>. Please refer to the details section for a detailed description.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ordered</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either TRUE or FALSE indicating whether the order of the classes in sets is considered or not.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>neighborhood</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either 'direct' or 'indirect' defines whether the given classes have to be direct neighbors ('direct') or there are other classes allowed inbetween ('indirect').</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>If more than one cascade is defined in sets, this parameter defines whether the filtered cascade has to
fit to at least one of the sets ('any') or to all of the given sets ('all').</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function allows for filtering the Subcascades object. 
</p>
<p>If <code>direction</code> is set to 'exact' the parameter <code>neighborhood</code> is ignored and the parameter <code>type</code> is used as its default and cannot be changed.
There has to be an exact match between the classes of the sets parameter cascades and the cascade of the Subcascades object, 
so not more but also not less classes are allowed. If the <code>ordered</code> parameter is set to TRUE also the order of the classes within the 
<code>sets</code> parameter and within the Subcascades object has be be exactly the same.
</p>
<p>If <code>direction</code> is set to 'sub' the Subcascades object is filtered for subsets of the given cascades. 
If the <code>type</code> parameter is set to 'any' each cascade is considered individually otherwise all cascades are used as reference for filtering.
This means that either for each cascade of the <code>sets</code> parameter individually or for taking all together the Subcascades object is filtered for cascades that are 
made up of the same classes, a subset of classes (<code>ordered = FALSE</code>) or a cascade, part of a cascade (<code>ordered = TRUE</code>), 
resulting in a set of cascades that might contain less classes.
The parameter <code>neighbourhood</code> is not considered.
</p>
<p>If <code>direction</code> is set to 'super' the Subcascades object is filtered for a superset of the given cascades. 
If the <code>type</code> parameter is set to 'any' each cascade is considered individually otherwise all cascades are used as reference for filtering.
A superset are cascades that are made up of (parts) of the given cascades (<code>ordered = TRUE</code>) or classes (<code>ordered=FALSE</code>) but can contain also more classes. 
Depending on the parameter <code>neighborhood</code> only classes defined in the <code>sets</code> parameter are allowed as neighbors ('direct').
If <code>neighborhood</code> is set to 'indirect' the filtering is less strict and the direct neighborhood defined in <code>sets</code> is not considered.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A Subcascades object comprising the evaluated cascades and their performances. 
The Subcascades object is made up of a list of matrices. 
Each matrix comprises the evaluation results of cascades of a specific length and 
is sorted row-wise according to the achieved minimal classwise sensitivities of the cascades (decreasing).
The rownames show the class order by a character string of type '1&gt;2&gt;3' and the entries the sensitivity for each position of the cascade.
