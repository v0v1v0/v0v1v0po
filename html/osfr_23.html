<h2>OSF Tibbles</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Items retrieved from OSF are represented as <code>osf_tbl</code> objects, specialized
data frames based on the tibble class. See below
for additional details.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Each row of an <code>osf_tbl</code> represents a single OSF entity. This could be a
user, project, component, directory, or file. An <code>osf_tbl</code> must include
the following 3 columns:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><code>name</code>: indicates the name or title of the entity.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>id</code>: the unique identifier assigned by OSF.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>meta</code>: a list-column that stores the processed response returned by OSF's
API. See the <em>Meta column</em> section below for more information.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Subclasses</h3>

<p><code>osf_tbl</code> is the parent class of 3 subclasses that are used to represent
each of OSF's main entities:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><code>osf_tbl_user</code> for users.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>osf_tbl_file</code> for files and directories.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>osf_tbl_node</code> for projects and components.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>OSF nodes</h3>

<p>Projects and components are both implemented as <em>nodes</em> on OSF. The only
distinction between the two is that a project is a top-level node, and a
component must have a parent node (i.e., must be a sub-component of another
project or component). Because projects and components are functionally
identical, osfr uses the same <code>osf_tbl_node</code> class to represent both.
</p>


<h3>Meta column</h3>

<p>The <code>meta</code> column contains all of the information returned from OSF's API for
a single entity, structured as a named list with 3 elements:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><code>attributes</code> contains metadata about the entity (e.g., names,
descriptions, tags, etc).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>links</code> contains urls to API endpoints with alternative representations of
the entity or actions that may be performed on the entity.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>relationships</code> contains URLs to other entities with relationships to the
entity (e.g., collaborators attached to a project).
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This information is critical for <code>osfr</code>'s internal functions and should not
be altered by users. For even more information about these elements, see
<a href="https://developer.osf.io/#tag/Entities-and-Entity-Collections">OSF's API documentation</a>.
