<h2>Breast cancer cell line data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p> This data set comes from a breast cancer cell line
microarray study. The experiment was done as
follows. First, the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was treated
with 17 beta-estradiol or ethanol (vehicle control). Then,
samples were harvested at 1, 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours
after treatment. At each time point, M = 8 replicate arrays
were prepared with each array consisting of G = 1901
genes.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Breast</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A matrix containing 1901 rows and 50 columns.</p>
