<h2>Add overlaps between annotation gene sets</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The app's network view of the enrichments results requires pairwise overlap
metrics between all the terms of each annotation in order to draw the edges
between the nodes/terms. These overlaps are calculated automatically when
installing or exporting an OmicNavigator study. If you'd like, you can
manually calculate these pairwise overlaps by calling <code>addOverlaps</code>
prior to installing or exporting your study.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">addOverlaps(study, reset = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>study</code></td>
<td>
<p>An OmicNavigator study created with <code>createStudy</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reset</code></td>
<td>
<p>Reset the data prior to adding the new data (default:
<code>FALSE</code>). The default is to add to or modify any previously added data
(if it exists). Setting <code>reset = TRUE</code> enables you to remove existing
data you no longer want to include in the study.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns the original <code>onStudy</code> object passed to the argument
<code>study</code>, but modified to include the newly added data
