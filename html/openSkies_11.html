<h2>Retrieve all state vectors received during a time interval
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Retrieves the list of all state vectors received from any or specified aircrafts
during an interval of time. A state vector is a collection of data elements that
characterize the status of an aircraft at a given point during a flight (such
as latitude, longitude, altitude, etc.)
</p>
<p>The starting and end time points must be specified as date-time strings in any 
format that can be  unambiguously converted to POSIXct (such as 
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS). Results can be filtered to specific ranges of latitudes 
and/or longitudes. This function requires access to the OpenSky Network Trino
query interface, and therefore can only be used by registered users that have been 
granted access to the Trino interface.
</p>
