Orongorongo Valley Brushtail Possums
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A subset of brushtail possum (<em>Trichosurus vulpecula</em>) data from the Orongorongo Valley live-trapping study of Efford (1998) and Efford and Cowan (2005) that was used by Pledger, Pollock and Norris (2003, 2010). The <code>OVpossumCH</code> dataset in <span class="pkg">secr</span> is a different selection of data from the same study. Consult ?OVpossumCH for more detail.
</p>
<p>The data comprise captures in February of each year from 1980 to 1988. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
FebpossumCH

</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The format is a 9-session <span class="pkg">secr</span> capthist object. Capture locations are not included.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data are captures of 448 animals (175 females and 273 males) over 9 trapping sessions comprising 4–10 occasions each. All were independent of their mothers, but age was not otherwise distinguished. The individual covariate <code>sex</code> takes values ‘F’ or ‘M’.
</p>
<p>Pledger, Pollock and Norris (2010) fitted 2-class finite mixture models for capture probability p and apparent survival phi, with or without allowance for temporal (between year) variation, using captures from only the first day of each trapping session. The first-day data relate to 270 individuals (115 females and 155 males).
