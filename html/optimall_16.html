<h2>Multiwave Class for Multi-Wave Sampling Organization</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">optimall</span> defines three S4 classes for organizing the
multi-wave sampling workflow: <code>Wave</code>, <code>Phase</code>, and
<code>Multiwave</code>.
An object of class <code>Multiwave</code> holds metadata and a list of objects of
class <code>Phase</code>, which in turn holds metadata and a list of
objects of class
<code>Wave</code>. These three object classes are used together to organize the
workflow of multi-wave sampling designs.
