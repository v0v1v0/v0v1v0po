<h2>Extract the component from a model's expectation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function extracts the expected means, covariance, or thresholds from a model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">mxGetExpected(model, component, defvar.row=1, subname=model$name)
imxGetExpectationComponent(model, component, defvar.row=1, subname=model$name)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>
<p>MxModel object from which to extract the expectation component.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>component</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character vector. The name(s) of the component(s) to extract.  Recognized names are “covariance”, “means”, and “thresholds”.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>defvar.row</code></td>
<td>
<p>A row index. Which row to load for definition variables.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>subname</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of the submodel to evaluate.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The expected means, covariance, or thresholds can be extracted from
Normal (mxExpectationNormal), RAM (mxExpectationRAM), and
LISREL (mxExpectationLISREL) models. When more than one component
is requested, the components will be returned as a list.
</p>
<p>If component 'vector' is requested then the non-redundant coefficients
of the expected manifest distribution will be returned as a vector.
</p>
<p>If component 'standVector' is requested then the same parameter structure as
'vector' is returned, but it is standardized.  For Normal expectations the covariances
are returned as correlations, the means are returned as zeros, and the
thresholds are returned as z-scores.  For the thresholds the z-scores
are computed by using the model-implied means and variances.
</p>
<p>Note that capitalization is ignored for the 'standVector' option, so 'standvector'
is also acceptable.

<pre><code class="language-R">   
# ===============================================

require(OpenMx)

# = What do our starting values indicate about the expected data covariance? =
# ============================================================================
mxGetExpected(factorModel, "covariance")

# Oops. Starting values indicate an expected zero-covariance matrix.
# The model likely won't run from these start values.
# Let's adjust them:

factorModel = mxModel("One Factor", type = "RAM",
      manifestVars = manifests, latentVars = latents,
      # Reasonable start VALUES
	  mxPath(from = latents, to = manifests, values = .2),
      mxPath(from = manifests, arrows = 2),
      mxPath(from = latents, arrows = 2, free = FALSE, values = 1.0),
      mxPath(from = 'one', to = manifests),
	  mxData(demoOneFactor, type = "raw")
)

mxGetExpected(factorModel, "covariance")
#      x1   x2   x3   x4   x5

# x2 0.04 0.04 0.04 0.04 0.04

# And this version will run:
