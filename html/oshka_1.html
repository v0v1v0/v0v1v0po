<h2>Recursive Quoted Language Expansion</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Expands quoted language by recursively replacing any symbol that points to
quoted language with the language it points to.  The recursive process
continues until only symbols that point to non-language objects remain.  The
resulting quoted language can then be evaluated normally.  This differs from
the traditional 'quote'/'eval' pattern because it resolves intermediate
language objects that would interfere with evaluation.
