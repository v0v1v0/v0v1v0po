<h2>Slater distances (standardized Euclidean distances).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The euclidean distance is often used as a measure of similarity between elements (see <code>distance()</code>. A drawback of
this measure is that it depends on the range of the rating scale and the number of constructs used, i. e. on the
size of a grid. <br> An approach to standardize the euclidean distance to make it independent from size and range of
ratings and was proposed by Slater (1977, pp. 94). The 'Slater distance' is the Euclidean distance divided by the
expected distance. Slater distances bigger than 1 are greater than expected, lesser than 1 are smaller than
expected. The minimum value is 0 and values bigger than 2 are rarely found. Slater distances have been be used to
compare inter-element distances between different grids, where the grids do not need to have the same constructs or
elements. Hartmann (1992) showed that Slater distance is not independent of grid size. Also the distribution of the
Slater distances is asymmetric. Hence, the upper and lower limit to infer 'significance' of distance is not
symmetric. The practical relevance of Hartmann's findings have been demonstrated by Schoeneich and Klapp (1998). To
calculate Hartmann's version of the standardized distances see <code>distanceHartmann()</code>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">distanceSlater(x, trim = 20, index = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>repgrid</code> object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trim</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of characters a construct or element is trimmed to (default is
<code>20</code>). If <code>NA</code> no trimming occurs. Trimming
simply saves space when displaying correlation of constructs
with long names.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>index</code></td>
<td>
<p>Whether to print the number of the construct or element
in front of the name (default is <code>TRUE</code>). This is useful to avoid
identical row names, which may cause an error.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix with Slater distances.
</p>


<h3>Calculation</h3>

<p>The Slater distance is calculated as follows.
For a derivation see Slater (1977, p.94).       <br>
Let matrix <code class="reqn">D</code> contain the row centered ratings. Then
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">P = D^TD</code>
</p>
<p> and
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">S = tr(P)</code>
</p>

<p>The expected 'unit of expected distance' results as     <br></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">U = (2S/(m-1))^{1/2}</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">m</code> denotes the number of elements of the grid.
The standardized Slater distances is the matrix of Euclidean distances
<code class="reqn">E</code> divided by the expected distance <code class="reqn">U</code>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">E/U</code>
</p>
