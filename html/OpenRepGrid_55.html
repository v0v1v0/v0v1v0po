<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A description by the authors: "When Teresa, 22 years old, was seen by the second author (LAS) at the psychological
services of the University of Salamanca, she was in the final year of her studies in chemical sciences. Although
Teresa proves to be an excellent student, she reveals serious doubts about her self worth. She cries frequently, and
has great difficulty in meeting others, even though she has a boyfriend who is extremely supportive. Teresa is
anxiously hesitant about accepting a new job which would involve moving to another city 600 Km away from home."
(Feixas &amp; Saul, 2004, p. 77).
