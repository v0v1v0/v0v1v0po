<h2>Add maximum richness objective</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Set the objective of a project prioritization <code>problem()</code> to
maximize the total number of features that are expected to persist, whilst
ensuring that the cost of the solution is within a pre-specified budget
(Joseph, Maloney &amp; Possingham 2009). This objective is conceptually similar
to maximizing species richness in a study area. Furthermore, weights can
also be used to specify the relative importance of conserving specific
features (see <code>add_feature_weights()</code>).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A problem objective is used to specify the overall goal of the
project prioritization problem.
Here, the maximum richness objective seeks to find the set of actions that
maximizes the total number of features  (e.g. populations, species,
ecosystems) that is expected to persist within a pre-specified budget.
Let <code class="reqn">I</code> represent the set of conservation actions (indexed by
<code class="reqn">i</code>). Let <code class="reqn">C_i</code> denote the cost for funding action <code class="reqn">i</code>, and
let <code class="reqn">m</code> denote the maximum expenditure (i.e. the budget). Also,
let <code class="reqn">F</code> represent each feature (indexed by <code class="reqn">f</code>), <code class="reqn">W_f</code>
represent the weight for each feature <code class="reqn">f</code> (defaults to one for
each feature unless specified otherwise), and <code class="reqn">E_f</code> denote the
probability that each feature will go extinct given the funded
conservation projects.
</p>
<p>To guide the prioritization, the conservation actions are organized into
conservation projects. Let <code class="reqn">J</code> denote the set of conservation projects
(indexed by <code class="reqn">j</code>), and let <code class="reqn">A_{ij}</code> denote which actions
<code class="reqn">i \in I</code> comprise each conservation project
<code class="reqn">j \in J</code> using zeros and ones. Next, let <code class="reqn">P_j</code> represent
the probability of project <code class="reqn">j</code> being successful if it is funded. Also,
let <code class="reqn">B_{fj}</code> denote the probability that each feature
<code class="reqn">f \in F</code> associated with the project <code class="reqn">j \in J</code>
will persist if all of the actions that comprise project <code class="reqn">j</code> are funded
and that project is allocated to feature <code class="reqn">f</code>. For convenience,
let <code class="reqn">Q_{fj}</code> denote the actual probability that each
<code class="reqn">f \in F</code> associated with the project <code class="reqn">j \in J</code>
is expected to persist if the project is funded. If the argument
to <code>adjust_for_baseline</code> in the <code>problem</code> function was set to
<code>TRUE</code>, and this is the default behavior, then
<code class="reqn">Q_{fj} = (P_{j} \times B_{fj}) + \bigg(\big(1 - (P_{j} B_{fj})\big)
  \times (P_{n} \times B_{fn})\bigg)</code>, where <code>n</code> corresponds to the
baseline "do nothing" project. This means that the probability
of a feature persisting if a project is allocated to a feature
depends on (i) the probability of the project succeeding, (ii) the
probability of the feature persisting if the project does not fail,
and (iii) the probability of the feature persisting even if the project
fails. Otherwise, if the argument is set to <code>FALSE</code>, then
<code class="reqn">Q_{fj} = P_{j} \times B_{fj}</code>.
</p>
<p>The binary control variables <code class="reqn">X_i</code> in this problem indicate whether
each project <code class="reqn">i \in I</code> is funded or not. The decision
variables in this problem are the <code class="reqn">Y_{j}</code>, <code class="reqn">Z_{fj}</code>, and <code class="reqn">E_f</code>
variables.
Specifically, the binary <code class="reqn">Y_{j}</code> variables indicate if project <code class="reqn">j</code>
is funded or not based on which actions are funded; the binary
<code class="reqn">Z_{fj}</code> variables indicate if project <code class="reqn">j</code> is used to manage
feature <code class="reqn">f</code> or not; and the semi-continuous <code class="reqn">E_f</code> variables
denote the probability that feature <code class="reqn">f</code> will go extinct.
</p>
<p>Now that we have defined all the data and variables, we can formulate
the problem. For convenience, let the symbol used to denote each set also
represent its cardinality (e.g. if there are ten features, let <code class="reqn">F</code>
represent the set of ten features and also the number ten).

<p>The objective (eqn 1a) is to maximize the weighted persistence of all the
species. Constraint (eqn 1b) limits the maximum expenditure (i.e. ensures
that the cost of the funded actions do not exceed the budget).
Constraints (eqn 1c) calculate the probability that each feature
will go extinct according to their allocated project.
Constraints (eqn 1d) ensure that feature can only be allocated to projects
that have all of their actions funded. Constraints (eqn 1e) state that each
feature can only be allocated to a single project. Constraints (eqn 1f)
ensure that a project cannot be funded unless all of its actions are funded.
Constraints (eqns 1g) ensure that the probability variables
(<code class="reqn">E_f</code>) are bounded between zero and one. Constraints (eqns 1h) ensure
that the action funding (<code class="reqn">X_i</code>), project funding (<code class="reqn">Y_j</code>), and project
allocation (<code class="reqn">Z_{fj}</code>) variables are binary.
