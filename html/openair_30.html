<h2>Calculate common model evaluation statistics</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function to calculate common numerical model evaluation statistics with
flexible conditioning.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">modStats(
  mydata,
  mod = "mod",
  obs = "obs",
  statistic = c("n", "FAC2", "MB", "MGE", "NMB", "NMGE", "RMSE", "r", "COE", "IOA"),
  type = "default",
  rank.name = NULL,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mydata</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mod</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of a variable in <code>mydata</code> that represents modelled
values.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>obs</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of a variable in <code>mydata</code> that represents measured
values.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>statistic</code></td>
<td>
<p>The statistic to be calculated. See details below for a
description of each.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>type</code> determines how the data are split i.e. conditioned,
and then plotted. The default is will produce statistics using the entire
data. <code>type</code> can be one of the built-in types as detailed in
<code>cutData</code> e.g. “season”, “year”, “weekday” and so
on. For example, <code>type = "season"</code> will produce four sets of
statistics — one for each season.
</p>
<p>It is also possible to choose <code>type</code> as another variable in the data
frame. If that variable is numeric, then the data will be split into four
quantiles (if possible) and labelled accordingly. If type is an existing
character or factor variable, then those categories/levels will be used
directly. This offers great flexibility for understanding the variation of
different variables and how they depend on one another.
</p>
<p>More than one type can be considered e.g. <code>type = c("season",
  "weekday")</code> will produce statistics split by season and day of the week.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rank.name</code></td>
<td>
<p>Simple model ranking can be carried out if <code>rank.name</code>
is supplied. <code>rank.name</code> will generally refer to a column representing
a model name, which is to ranked. The ranking is based the COE performance,
as that indicator is arguably the best single model performance indicator
available.</p>

<p>Number of quantiles to split numeric data into.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>start.day</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>What day of the week should the <code>type = "weekday"</code>
start on?  The user can change the start day by supplying an integer
between 0 and 6. Sunday = 0, Monday = 1, ... For example to start the
weekday plots on a Saturday, choose <code>start.day = 6</code>.</p>

zones that should be valid for most systems. It is important that the
original data are in GMT (UTC) or a fixed offset from GMT. See

and ensure no DST is applied.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is under development and currently provides some common model
evaluation statistics. These include (to be mathematically defined later):
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">n</code>, the number of complete pairs of data.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">FAC2</code>, fraction of predictions within a factor of two.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">MB</code>, the mean bias.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">MGE</code>, the mean gross error.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">NMB</code>, the normalised mean bias.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">NMGE</code>, the normalised mean gross error.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">RMSE</code>, the root mean squared error.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">r</code>, the Pearson correlation coefficient. Note, can also supply and
argument <code>method</code> e.g. <code>method = "spearman"</code>. Also returned is the
P value of the correlation coefficient, <code class="reqn">P</code>, which may present as <code>0</code> for
very low values.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">COE</code>, the <em>Coefficient of Efficiency</em> based on Legates and
McCabe (1999, 2012). There have been many suggestions for measuring model
performance over the years, but the COE is a simple formulation which is easy
to interpret.
</p>
<p>A perfect model has a COE = 1. As noted by Legates and McCabe although the
COE has no lower bound, a value of COE = 0.0 has a fundamental meaning. It
implies that the model is no more able to predict the observed values than
does the observed mean. Therefore, since the model can explain no more of the
variation in the observed values than can the observed mean, such a model can
have no predictive advantage.
</p>
<p>For negative values of COE, the model is less effective than the observed
mean in predicting the variation in the observations. </p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">IOA</code>, the
Index of Agreement based on Willmott et al. (2011), which spans between -1
and +1 with values approaching +1 representing better model performance.
</p>
<p>An IOA of 0.5, for example, indicates that the sum of the error-magnitudes is
one half of the sum of the observed-deviation magnitudes.  When IOA = 0.0, it
signifies that the sum of the magnitudes of the errors and the sum of the
observed-deviation magnitudes are equivalent. When IOA = -0.5, it indicates
that the sum of the error-magnitudes is twice the sum of the perfect
model-deviation and observed-deviation magnitudes. Values of IOA near -1.0
can mean that the model-estimated deviations about O are poor estimates of
the observed deviations; but, they also can mean that there simply is little
observed variability - so some caution is needed when the IOA approaches -1.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All statistics are based on complete pairs of <code>mod</code> and <code>obs</code>.
</p>
<p>Conditioning is possible through setting <code>type</code>, which can be a vector
e.g. <code>type = c("weekday", "season")</code>.
</p>
