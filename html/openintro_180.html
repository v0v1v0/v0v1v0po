<h2>Malaria Vaccine Trial</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Volunteer patients were randomized into one of two experiment groups where
they would receive an experimental vaccine or a placebo.  They were
subsequently exposed to a drug-sensitive strain of malaria and observed to
see whether they came down with an infection.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">malaria
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 20 observations on the following 2 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>treatment</dt>
<dd>
<p>Whether a person was given the experimental <code>vaccine</code> or a <code>placebo</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>outcome</dt>
<dd>
<p>Whether the person got an <code>infection</code> or <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠no infection⁠</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In this study, volunteer patients were randomized into one of two experiment
groups: 14 patients received an experimental vaccine or 6 patients received
a placebo vaccine.  Nineteen weeks later, all 20 patients were exposed to a
drug-sensitive malaria virus strain; the motivation of using a
drug-sensitive strain of virus here is for ethical considerations, allowing
any infections to be treated effectively.
