<h2>Add a heuristic solver</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Specify that solutions should be generated using a backwards step-wise
heuristic algorithm (inspired by Cabeza <em>et al.</em> 2004,
Korte &amp; Vygen 2000, Probert <em>et al.</em> 2016). Ideally,
solutions should be generated using exact algorithm solvers (e.g.
<code>add_rsymphony_solver()</code> or <code>add_gurobi_solver()</code>)
because they are guaranteed to identify optimal solutions (Rodrigues &amp; Gaston
2002).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_heuristic_solver(
  x,
  number_solutions = 1,
  initial_sweep = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>ProjectProblem object.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>number_solutions</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>integer</code> number of solutions desired.
Defaults to 1. Note that the number of returned solutions can sometimes
be less than the argument to <code>number_solutions</code> depending on the
argument to <code>solution_pool_method</code>, for example if 100
solutions are requested but only 10 unique solutions exist, then only 10
solutions will be returned.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>initial_sweep</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>logical</code> value indicating if projects and
actions which exceed the budget should be automatically excluded
prior to running the backwards heuristic. This step prevents
projects which exceed the budget, and so would never be selected in
the final solution, from biasing the cost-sharing calculations.
However, previous algorithms for project prioritization have not
used this step (e.g. Probert <em>et al.</em> 2016).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The heuristic algorithm used to generate solutions is described
below. It is heavily inspired by the cost-sharing backwards heuristic
algorithm conventionally used to guide the prioritization of species
recovery projects (Probert <em>et al.</em> 2016).
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> All actions and projects are initially selected for funding.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A set of rules are then used to deselect actions and projects
based on locked constraints (if any). Specifically, (i) actions which are
which are locked out are deselected, and (ii) projects which are
associated with actions that are locked out are also deselected.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If the argument to <code>initial_sweep</code> is <code>TRUE</code>, then a set of
rules are then used to deselect actions and projects
based on budgetary constraints (if present). Specifically, (i) actions
which exceed the budget are deselected, (ii) projects which are
associated with a set of actions that exceed the budget are deselected,
and (iii) actions which are not associated with any project (excepting
locked in actions) are also deselected.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If the objective function is to maximize biodiversity subject
to budgetary constraints (e.g. <code>add_max_richness_objective()</code>)
then go to step 5. Otherwise, if the objective is to minimize cost
subject to biodiversity constraints (i.e.
<code>add_min_set_objective()</code>) then go to step 7.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The next step is repeated until (i) the number of desired
solutions is obtained, and (ii) the total cost of the remaining
actions that are selected for funding is within the budget. After both of
these conditions are met, the algorithm is terminated.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Each of the remaining projects that are currently selected for
funding are evaluated according to how much the performance of the
solution decreases when the project is deselected for funding, relative to
the cost of the project not shared by other remaining projects. This can
be expressed mathematically as:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">B_j = \frac{V(J) - V(J - j)}{C_j}</code>
</p>

<p>Where <code class="reqn">J</code> is the set of remaining projects currently
selected for funding (indexed by <code class="reqn">j</code>), <code class="reqn">B_j</code> is the benefit
associated with funding project <code class="reqn">j</code>, <code class="reqn">V(J)</code> is the objective
value associated with the solution where all remaining projects are
funded, <code class="reqn">V(J - j)</code> is the objective value associated with the
solution where all remaining projects except for project <code class="reqn">j</code> are
funded, and <code class="reqn">C_j</code> is the sum cost of all of the actions
associated with project <code class="reqn">j</code>—excluding locked in actions—with the
cost of each action divided by the total number of remaining
projects that share the action (e.g. if two projects both share a $100
action, then this action contributes $50 to the overall cost of each
project).
</p>
<p>The project with the smallest benefit (i.e. <code class="reqn">B_j</code> value) is then
deselected for funding. In cases where multiple projects have
the same benefit (<code class="reqn">B_j</code>) value, the project with the greatest overall
cost (including actions which are shared among multiple remaining
projects) is deselected.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The next step is repeated until (i) the number of desired
solutions is obtained or (ii) no action can be deselected for funding
without the probability of any feature expecting to persist falling below
its target probability of persistence. After one or both of
these conditions are met, the algorithm is terminated.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Each of the remaining projects that are currently selected for
funding are evaluated according to how much the performance of the
solution decreases when the project is deselected for funding, relative to
the cost of the project not shared by other remaining projects. This can
be expressed mathematically as:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">B_j = \frac{\big(\sum_{f}^{F} P_f(J) - T_f \big) -
   \big( \sum_{f}^{F} P_f(J - j) - T_f \big)}{C_j}</code>
</p>

<p>Where <code class="reqn">F</code> is the set of features (indexed by <code class="reqn">f</code>),
<code class="reqn">T_f</code> is the target for feature <code class="reqn">f</code>, <code class="reqn">P</code> is the set of
remaining projects that are selected for funding (indexed by <code class="reqn">j</code>),
<code class="reqn">C_j</code> is the cost of all of the actions
associated with project <code class="reqn">j</code>—excluding locked in actions—and
accounting for shared costs among remaining projects (e.g. if two
projects both share a $100 action, then this action contributes $50 to
the overall cost of each project), <code class="reqn">B_p</code> is the benefit
associated with funding project <code class="reqn">p</code>, <code class="reqn">P(J)</code> is probability
that each feature is expected to persist when the remaining projects
(<code class="reqn">J</code>) are funded, and <code class="reqn">P(J - j)</code> is the probability that
each feature is expected to persist when all the remaining projects except
for action <code class="reqn">j</code> are funded.
</p>
<p>The project with the smallest benefit (i.e. <code class="reqn">B_j</code> value) is then
deselected for funding. In cases where multiple projects have
the same <code class="reqn">B_j</code> value, the project with the greatest overall cost
(including actions which are shared among multiple remaining projects)
is deselected.
