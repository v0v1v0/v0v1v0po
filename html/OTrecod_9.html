<p>A. THE RECODING PROBLEM IN DATA FUSION
</p>
<p>Assuming that <code class="reqn">Y</code> and <code class="reqn">Z</code> are two target variables which refered to the same target population in two separate databases A and B respectively (no overlapping rows),
so that <code class="reqn">Y</code> and <code class="reqn">Z</code> are never jointly observed. Assuming also that A and B share a subset of common covariates <code class="reqn">X</code> of any types (same encodings in A and B)
completed or not. Merging these two databases often requires to solve a recoding problem by creating an unique database where
the missing information of <code class="reqn">Y</code> and <code class="reqn">Z</code> is fully completed.
</p>
<p>B. DESCRIPTION OF THE FUNCTION
</p>
<p>The function <code>indiv_grp_optimal</code> is an intermediate function used in the implementation of an algorithm called <code>OUTCOME</code> (and its enrichment <code>R-OUTCOME</code> (2)) dedicated to the solving of recoding problems in data fusion using Optimal Transportation theory.
The model is implemented in the function <code>OT_outcome</code> which integrates the function <code>indiv_grp_optimal</code> in its syntax as a possible second step of the algorithm.
The function <code>indiv_grp_optimal</code> can nevertheless be used separately providing that the argument <code>proxim</code> receives an output object of the function <code>proxim_dist</code>.
This latter is available in the package and is so directly usable beforehand.
</p>
<p>The function <code>indiv_grp_optimal</code> constitutes an alternative method to the nearest neighbor procedure implemented in the function <code>indiv_grp_closest</code>.
As for the function <code>indiv_grp_closest</code>, assuming that the objective consists in the prediction of <code class="reqn">Z</code> in the database A, the first step of the algorithm related to <code>OUTCOME</code> provides an estimate of <code class="reqn">\gamma</code>, the solution of the optimization problem, which can be seen, in this case as an estimation of the joint distribution <code class="reqn">(Y,Z)</code> in A.
Rather than using a nearest neighbor approach to provide individual predictions, the function <code>indiv_grp_optimal</code> solves an optimization problem using the simplex algorithm which searches for the individual predictions of <code class="reqn">Z</code> that minimize the computed total distance satisfying the joint probability distribution estimated in the first part.
More details about the theory related to the solving of this optimization problem is described in the section 5.3 of (2).
</p>
<p>Obviously, this algorithm  runs in the same way for the prediction of <code class="reqn">Y</code> in the database B.
The function <code>indiv_grp_optimal</code> integrates in its syntax the function <code>avg_dist_closest</code> and the related argument <code>percent_closest</code> is identical in the two functions.
Thus, when computing average distances between an individual i and a subset of individuals assigned to a same level of <code class="reqn">Y</code> or <code class="reqn">Z</code> is required, user can decide if all individuals from the subset of interest can participate to the computation (<code>percent_closest = 1</code>) or only a fixed part p (&lt;1) corresponding to the closest neighbors of i (in this case <code>percent_closest</code> = p).
</p>
<p>The arguments <code>jointprobaA</code> and <code>jointprobaB</code> can be seen as estimations of <code class="reqn">\gamma</code> (sum of cells must be equal to 1) that correspond to estimations of the joint distributions of <code class="reqn">(Y,Z)</code> in A and B respectively.
</p>
<p>The argument <code>solvr</code> permits user to choose the solver of the optimization algorithm. The default solver is "glpk" that corresponds to the GNU Linear Programming Kit (see (3) for more details). The solver "clp" (see (4)) for Coin-or Linear Programming, convenient in linear and quadratic situations, is also directly integrated in the function.
Moreover, the function actually uses the <code>R</code> optimization infrastructure of the package <span class="pkg">ROI</span> which offers a wide choice of solver to users by easily loading the associated plugins of <span class="pkg">ROI</span> (see (5)).
