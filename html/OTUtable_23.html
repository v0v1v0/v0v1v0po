<h2>
Taxonomic assignments of OTUs
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing the taxonomy of each OTU in the otu_table
Produced from mothur output using clean_taxonomy()
Bootstrap values have been removed from this dataset, but are still available in as part of the Data folder in the McMahonLab/North_Temperate_Lakes-Microbial_Observatory GitHub repo
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(taxonomy)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A dataframe with 7 columns (taxonomic levels) and 6,208 rows	(OTUs)
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Classified using our Freshwater database, followed by Greengenes - for the full workflow, visit the McMahonLab Github 16STax-Ass repository
Some OTUs are missing; these were removed by subsampling of the OTU table
The presence of both blank (__) assignments and "unclassified" assignments are the result of the dual classification.
